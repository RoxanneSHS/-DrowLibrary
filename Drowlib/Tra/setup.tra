-from the 'Book of the World',
excerpted from 'The Origin
Myths- A Treatise by Dunkelzahn
of Candlekeep, 1354 DR.

". . . The World was still flat, here before the beginning of Time, before Asgorath the World-Shaper folded the cloth of existence into its final form.  The World was flat,
and above it hung the Crystal Sun that Zotha had wrought before Asgorath cast him down.  Asgorath soared above the World and looked down upon it, and she saw that it was good.
"And so Asgorath bent her form around the Crystal Sun, and touched her breath to it.  And the Crystal Sun burst into fragments that pierced the flesh of Asgorath, and her blood fell on the World.  Where the drops fell, the Powers of the World and the Powers of the Crystal Sun came together, and the Spawn of Asgorath came forth
upon the face of the World.

"Red, they were, red that would later depart from its purity.  But here before the beginning of Time, their red was the pure red of the shattered Crystal Sun. They spread their wings and took to the skies, circling around the still, cold form of Asgorath. One after another, score upon score, they bent their breath against the body of Asgorath, and the skies rang with their lamentations. Only one of the Spawn of Asgorath withheld his breath. Instead, he pulled a shard of the Crystal Sun from the flesh of Asgorath, and used it to draw blood from his own flesh, and this blood fell upon the face of the World.

"As before, there was movement where the blood fell, but the creatures that came forth from this blood were not of the pure red. Colored like the products of the World they were, like the unliving metals. And the Renegade raised his voice, and his voice was a trumpet: 'I too have Created.'

"The form of Asgorath began to stir, as the Renegade knew it must.  The Renegade spread his wings and flew, and the Spawn of the Renegade followed him into the farthest reaches of the world."~

@650054 = ~History of Hotun Shûl~
@650055 = ~Annam Betrayed

Shortly before the giants' war with dragonkind came to its bitter conclusion, Othea, Annam's wife, developed an interest in a minor sea god known as Ulutiu. (This was hardly her first adulterous foray; long before this, she had betrayed Annam with Vaprak resulting in the creation of the ogre race.)  During the last few years of the war, while Annam was preoccupied, the pair carried on a passionate affair they hoped to conceal from the jealous All-Father.  Ultimately, the union of Othea and Ulutiu produced four sons, who later founded the four giant-kin dynasties: firbolg, verbeeg, voadkyn, and fomorian. (Actually, there is some dispute about whether the voadkyn are actually the sons of Annam or Ulutiu as noted in 'The Kin.'  For their part, the giants themselves place the voadkyn in the latter category.)

To this day, the enmity between giant and giant-kin stems from the illegitimacy of Ulutiu's offspring in the eyes of Annam and his sons.  Despite Othea's best efforts, Annam eventually discovered her dalliance and sought revenge upon Ulutiu.  Although accounts of the All-Father's retribution vary, most giants accept the version of events popularized by the friezes at Hotun-Shûl, an enormous underground temple located somewhere beneath the Ice Spires.  Fabled for their artistry and expanse (no human artist could possibly hew such colossal masterpieces from the living rock of the caverns), the friezes were sculpted by Illsenstaad, second son of Obadai and one of the earliest stone giants.  Although the friezes themselves haven't been glimpsed since Hotun-Shûl was razed by mysterious subterranean marauders more than 400 years ago, sketches and interpretations crafted by artisans who once visited the temple are available in the Realms' larger libraries.~

@650056 = ~History of Netheril's Fall~
@650057 = ~History of Netheril's Fall

In 3520NY, the archwizard Ioulaum disappeared. Several of his friends, including Karsus, believed he left Netheril because he depended heavily on magic to maintain his life (after all, he was nearly 3,000 years old).  His final fate remained unknown.

Panic surged through Netheril as the citizens learned of Ioulaum's disappearance, and the archwizards that remained feared that there would be a revolt.  Karsus, feeling the responsibility for Netheril's future on his shoulders, felt that it was his duty to weld the nation back together.  He finished a spell that he'd been working on for years and then cast it upon himself.

This spell, called Karsus's Avatar, was the only 12th-level spell ever created.  It was designed to temporarily steal the powers of a deity.  When he cast the spell, he chose Mystryl, the goddess of magic, in the process changing forever the way magic functions.  Knowledge has always outweighed wisdom, and Karsus was no exception.

His body swelled with the sudden influx of godly power, and his mind filled with unimaginable knowledge.  Karsus instantly realized the horrible mistake he had made: He stole the power from the one god he shouldn't have.  Mystryl's position called for one of the aspects of her psyche to constantly rework the weave of magic-the weave that Netheril and its glut of magic and the phaerimm with their magic drain spells constantly threatened to unravel.  When Mystryl lost her ability to keep the weave of essential magic (magic in its purest unschooled and unfielded form) intact, the inundation of magic surged and fluctuated, and the effects of all things magical doubled for a time- a short time.

Mystryl sacrificed herself to save the weave before the damage became irreparable.  This broke Karsus's link to her magic and obstructed the weave, causing all magic to briefly cease functioning.  Without the infusion of magic, the floating cities of Netheril fell, and Karsus was instantly slain.  His bloated body petrified and toppled from the high plateau above his floating city and plummeted to earth.  As his body fell, his stony eyes, still shimmering with the last glint of godly omniscience, caught a glimpse of the cities of Netheril smashing to the ground, killing all their inhabitants.  His heart broke-greed for the power of the deities themselves caused the destruction of his home, his family, his friends, and his people.

When Mystryl reincarnated herself- this time as Mystra- she used the form of a beautiful peasant girl learning the basics of cantra magic but with the capacities for archwizardry. Her first priority was to recreate the weave of magic.  This time, she made magic follow a few more rules, and no spell above 10th level would function. By the time she was completed, she was able to save only three of Netheril's floating cities; the rest were utterly destroyed.  These three-Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath- were high enough above the ground to survive. The cities safely landed, and the survivors stumbled away from the cities in shock.

Priests and priestesses of the new goddess of magic were told the story of Karsus in dreams and visions when they prayed for spells.  It was Mystra's attempt to make sure that nothing like this ever happened again.  Yet Karsus was accredited as being the only human to have ever achieved godhood through spellcasting, even if was only for a fleeting moment.

Within a few short months, the inhabitants of the surviving three cities left, fearful of the phaerimm, the gods, and the orcs.  About one-third migrated northward, with the rest traveling south to create the shadows- or "survivor states" for the optimistic- of Netheril; Anauria, Asram, and Hlondath.

Some of those who traveled north followed "dream visions" and built a small city near the bleeding red stone corpse of Karsus, mistaking the former archwizard's petrified corpse as that of a dying god.  They named their city Karse in honor of the finding of their "god."  Their worship of Karsus angered other nearby denizens, however, and it was widely held that the lich Wulgreth had the city destroyed in 3533NY in retribution for what Karsus had done to him.  Other sages, however, believe Wulgreth was busy in Ascalhorn trying to destroy what remained of Netheril, piece by piece, patiently enacting his revenge, growing more and more evil as time went on.

Wulgreth opened a gate to Baator in secret, seeking aid for his quest and receiving it.  Ascalhorn was slowly infiltrated by baatezu as the centuries slowly marched onward.  The fiends served first as servitors, but they quickly acted as schemers and go-betweens for the powerful arcanists of the city, encouraging rivalries, misunderstandings, and fears.  Within a millennium, Ascalhorn became Hellgate Keep.

---------------------------------------
The End of the End

In what was known as The End of the End, all that remained of Netheril was destroyed over 300 years.  It began in the year 3826NY when Asram was hit by the worst plague in the history of Toril, decimating the whole population in one month.  Even those who escaped the scourged area died.  It was believed Kiputytto (a god trying to take over Talona's portfolio) attempted to upset Talona's influence on Tori1 at about this time and was killed in the process.  Talona plagued the ill-fated Asram in order to get the prayers of salvation from the city's inhabitants who hoped to appease the god and lessen the effects of the disease.  With this sudden increase in patrons, Talona gained the power required to kill the deity Kiputytto and absorbed its powers.

In 3970NY, Anauria fell.  It succumbed to the weight of an orc attack.  When it fell, however, it delivered a blow to the marauding beasts that required a whole millennia to recover from.

The Crown Against Scepter Wars began in 4058NY and finally ended in 4167NY.  The wars between Cormanthyr and Hlondath were not long-lasting by any means, and few deaths were incurred by either side.  Mostly, it was a show of force and magical might, and Myth Drannor won most of them.  It's no wonder that Myth Drannor prevailed in most of the conflicts, for Hlondath was soon to fall. Its last dying breath went unheard in the year 4188NY as the desert of Anauroch consumed its fields, starving its people and sending them scurrying into the heart of Faerûn.~

@650058 = ~History of the Pirate Wars~
@650059 = ~History of the Pirate Wars

By 1201 DR, the pirate fleet of the Dragonisle numbered over 100 ships.  Without Immurk's strong leadership, the rough coalition he had formed came apart.  Half a dozen pirates declared themselves Immurk's successor, each with his own following of ships and captains, and the attentions of the pirates turned from raiding to internal warfare.  Several of the most vicious pirates of legend arose during this period.  Black Anzil, a Turmish pirate, dipped his enemies in pitch and set them alight. 'Lord' Chazdan, a Procampan noble turned pirate, would force his prisoners to drink quarts of alcohol until they died.  Respitil, a pirate-mage of the period, was known to bind captives to the mainmast and use summon swarm spells to bring a cloud of biting, stinging insects to devour them alive.  Urdogen 'the Red,' the pirate who eventually won dominance over the Dragonisle, forced his victims to devour their own ears, nose, and lips, then set them free as examples.  Urdogen, a red-haired hot-blooded bear of a man, eventually came to dominate the Dragonisle.  While he did not have the banner of all of the pirates, he had accumulated enough support so that none dared challenge him.  He seized Immurk's Hold, the large harbor on the Dragonisle, for his own, allowing those who had not joined him to harbor on the lesser isles of the archipelago.  Once the internal warfare was over, these pirates raided brutally.  Where Immurk had spread the depredations of his pirates out, gathering maximum booty while avoiding angering the coastal nations, Urdogen and his fellows began a systematic plundering of coastal villages and ships which could not be ignored. 	The rising Inner Sea kingdoms- Cormyr, Sembia, Impiltur, and the Vilhon Reach- united on the seas against the pirates.  The great fleet which these nations raised numbered  nearly 200 ships.  This fleet poured forth in three parts, approaching the Dragonisle from the north, east, and west.  The northern fleet, which had the shortest distance to travel, came  from the Sembian city of Selgaunt and comprised primarily Sembian warships and mercenary vessels.  It was also the smallest fleet, with only 50 vessels, but still represented a substantial force.  The northern fleet's task was to feint at the Dragonisle to bring Urdogen's fleet out of harbor, then hold them at sea until the other forces arrived.  The eastern fleet came from Procampur and Lyrabar, and comprised Impilturan and mercenary forces, as well as a small contingent sent by Aglarond (whose rulers at the time were the Gray Sisters, the sibling queens Thara and Ulea).  This force of 75 vessels waited along the northern edge of the Pirate Isles (near Kelthann) for the western fleet to drive Urdogen to them.  The western fleet, sent from Suzail, comprised forces from Cormyr (including over a dozen of the new Cormyrean Freesails) and the Vilhon Reach.  This fleet of 70 vessels was nearly the downfall of the entire plan. 	According to the agreement, the western fleet was to drive the exposed pirate fleet east, so that the three combined fleets could eliminate the pirate menace.  However, unfavorable winds from the north-northeast delayed their passage through the Neck by nearly 12 hours.  The battle began shortly after dawn, Eleint 11, 1209 DR.  Urdogen's fleet sailed out to meet the northern attackers with 90 ships, a clearly dominating force.  The northern fleet began its slow retreat, drawing Urdogen away from the Dragonisle and toward the rendezvous with the western fleet.  When it reached the rendezvous, however, the western fleet did not arrive, and the northern fleet was forced to engage with the pirates, hoping even though outnumbered to stall until the western fleet arrived.

By the following dawn, only 15 of the Sembian ships remained.  The pirates had taken a few losses, but even with the western fleet the battle was only once again even in ships, although the western fleet was not yet battle-weary.  Fortunately, the commander of the eastern fleet had been monitoring the progress of the battle through a crystal ball provided by the Gray Sisters.  When he perceived that the delay in the western fleet was going to destroy the Sembites, he set sail for the western rendezvous, arriving from the southeast (cutting off all retreat) only slightly after the western fleet.  The battle then became one of attrition, as pirate vessels struggled to escape the net formed by the 160 attacking ships.  Some pirates fled, while others were sunk by the rams and arbalests of the combined fleets.  Others ran aground on hidden reefs as they tried to escape; Urdogen himself, aboard the Raging Tears, may have suffered this fate.  The pirates' stronghold had been broken.  Not long after the victory, the allies once again separated. Sembia, which lost most of its own warships as well as having to pay mercenaries for the other ships lost, blamed Cormyr for the delay in the westem fleet.  Procampur and the city-states of Impiltur claimed a greater share of the prizes due to their heroic rescue of the other force, while Sembia demanded restitution for their heavier losses and Cormyr demanded a greater share due to the greater distance they had had to travel to reach the battle!  The Grey Sisters' representative, faced with petty bickering, returned to Aglarond.  A chance for a unified nation of the Inner Sea faded into nothing.~

@650061 = ~History of Seros~
@650062 = ~Epochs of the Inner Sea

No historical records date back to the Time of Dragons, as the early years of Faerûn's history are named.  Serôsian historians usually mark four major eras in its history, while it has just recently opened the doors to a new, fifth, era.

The First Epoch (Time of Beginnings): Stretching from fables and myths to the emergence of recorded history, the First Epoch looms large as a time of change as the Serôsian races all take to the sea.  Only the whales have much knowledge of this time, and all they sing of are the delights of meeting the new people of Serôs and of the dragons that loom large in the surfaceworld lands.  This Epoch ends with the elven migrations into Serôs and their Rise to power.

The Second Epoch (Time of the Elves): The Second Epoch begins officially with the building of Aryselmalyr.  This sea elven empire dominates all aspects of life, history, culture, and growth of all the races of Serôs, leaving changes to all the races that remain indelible today.  Major events of this era include the herding of the sahuagin into the Alamber Sea behind the Sharksbane Wall, the creation of the Dukars, the destruction of the kuo-toa as a power in the Inner Sea, and the initial migrations of shalarin into the Inner Sea. This era also marks the first extended intrusions into Serôs by living beings from the surfaceworld: the wizards of Netheril and other surface powers.  While the fall of Coryselmal began the fall of Aryselmalyr, the Second Epoch ended with forty years of wars and turmoil among the elves and the other races before achieving peace and settling into another Epoch.

The Third Epoch (Time of the Merfolk): At the start, the Hmur Imperium promised to be a bright and shining example of everything that Aryselmalyr once was.  For a time, the merfolk ruled Serôs almost as well as the elves.  However, it too fell to corrupt despotism, and its mad merfolk kings almost destroyed more of Serôs than the sahuagin.  Major events of this era include more shalarin and triton migrations into the depths, the loss of the Dukars, the final fall of the original morkoth civilizations, the rise of the sahuagin empire of Aleaxtis, the extinction of the locathah in the Alamber Sea, and the creation of the Timesong calendar.

The Fourth Epoch (Time of Tempering): Nearly all the sentient races of Serôs heard their oracles and priests predict the coming of three great challenges to 'temperthe mettle' of all the undersea races and change the currents of Serôs forever. Still wildly debated, many accept that the three great Forgers of Destiny (to borrow the merfolk prophetic term) were the collective tritons (who come to power during this epoch, upsetting the morkoth's control of the deep), the gods thrown into the sea during the Godswar (Sekolah, Umberlee, Anhur), and Iakhovas (whose recent invasion and resulting Twelfth Serôs War only just recently ended).

The Fifth Epoch (The Current Time): As this Epoch is just beginning, no major events of note have yet to be recorded beyond the everyday occurrences of life.  Still, oracles are peering into the future currents and watching for signs of what greatness (or dread) is to come.~

@650063 = ~History of the Bloodstone Lands~
@650064 = ~History of the Bloodstone Lands

For centuries, the story of the Bloodstone Lands was simply the story of Damara. The cold wastes of Vaasa attracted little attention from scholars (or anyone else!) outside the mountainous barricades of the region.  The people of Vaasa gathered in scattered communities of hunters, trappers, and farmers, all pitifully poor and eking out a squalid, uninteresting existence.  Damara, though, had a different tale to tell.  This kingdom traces its noble lines back almost three centuries, to the time when Heliogabalus was founded by Feldrin Bloodfeathers, the first king of Damara.  Thereafter, his long, unbroken line of kindly heirs ruled Damara well, only ending with King Virdin's death.  Until the most recent generation, the kingdom was a force on par with Impiltur.  Damara maintained strong trade relations with the city-states along the Moonsea and along all the reaches of the Sea of Fallen Stars.  The narrow gap between Rawlinswood and the southern expanse of the Earthspurs is still known as Merchants Run, though few merchants use it today.  At the height of Damara's glory, long caravans of merchants transported chalcedony down this pass to the fortress of Ilmwatch along the Easting Reach.  They were welcomed and even protected by the legions of Impiltur.  Fortified by brigades of Impilturian soldiers, the Damaran merchants then crossed through the Traders Bay region and into the great port of Sarshel.  Ships from Thesk and all the nations floating vessels on the the Sea of Fallen Stars met the merchants with open arms and open purses.

A second trade route, shorter but more difficult, carried the precious stone through Bloodstone Pass, the only sensible trail through the mighty Galenas.  From there, the stone went to points north and west.  Because it crossed through the wilds of Vaasa and through the Earthspur Mountains along Garumn's Climb, this route was not preferred.  But Garumn's Climb has proven invaluable to Sembia and the city-states on the Moonsea, especially in times of heavy pirate activity, or on such occasions as when the Moonsea was cut off from the main waterway by a particularly nasty dragon turtle, as happened a few decades ago.

The bloodstone was traded in bars, each measured at 25 gold pieces in value.  The crest of a Damaran noble house marked every bar, and on the opposite side was the year in Damaran reckoning.  Nearly 1,000,000 gold pieces worth of the stone was taken annually from the mines in the Galenas alone.  Particularly rich was the small region surrounding Bloodstone Pass, aptly named the Barony of Bloodstone.  This annual yield of raw wealth more than kept the interest of merchants and speculators, and therefore the craftsmen, farmers, and ordinary folk of Damara lived quite well.  Furthermore, Damara had little to fear from its neighbors.  Protected by imposing natural boundaries, with the noble houses united under the rule of a single well-accepted king, there was little cause for unrest.  The king maintained an army only to protect the caravans, and to defend the outlying rural communities from bands of raiding goblins or other wretched creatures.  Certainly, the scattered tribes of Vaasa could never unite or pose more than a marginal threat.  Peace was the norm, and the expectation of future prosperity, obvious.

Or so the Damarans thought. The merchants could never have guessed that the bloodstone bars would in time be called 'cursed money,' shunned by all outside the region for fear that it would bring to the user the same disastrous fate that befell Damara!

---------------------------------------
The Rise of the Witch-King

Barely twelve years ago, in FR1137, a calamitous event in the wastes of Vaasa rocked the stability of the entire region.  In a single night, the evil fortress Castle Perilous arose on a lonely crag only 60 miles north of the Galenas and the Damaran border.  Out from this bastion of wickedness stepped Zhengyi the Witch-King, a lich of unspeakable powers.  The Witch-King claimed the sovereign powers of the kingdom of Vaasa.  Winning the cold hearts of the countless goblins, orcs, and giants living in the mountains, the Witch-King pulled them all into his fold.  Zhengyi enlisted the aid of powerful denizens of the lower planes and surrounded himself with the foul priests of Orcus, who could raise and command legions of undead.  With this vast army swiftly assembled, and further aided by the infamous Grandfather of Assassins and his foul guild, the Witch-King prepared for war. Damara's eyes were blind to the sudden rise of Zhengyi.  At the time of the Witch-King's rise, the kingdom was suffering a series of catastrophies; events which, in hindsight, seem suspiciously connected with the Witch-King.  First, a nameless evil awakened in the Mines of Bloodstone, a force that drove the men and dwarves from the place in terror.  These mines had been the primary source of wealth for the northern barony.  Indeed, up to that time, the wealth rolling out of them- more that 400,000 gold pieces annually- represented nearly half of all the bloodstone flowing out of Damara.  Hundreds of brave men tried to reclaim the mines in the next few months, but none returned.

Wolf Winter fell that same year.  Early frosts destroyed the harvest and the winter that ensued was therefore doubly terrible.  Starvation was common among man and beast alike.  Packs of dire wolves swept into northern Damara from the Galenas, leaving little but bloodied snow in their wake.  Even worse, many of the wolves were infected with lycanthropy.  The Witch-King's armies roared down to the Galenas the very next year, cutting off Bloodstone Pass and effectively shutting down all the mines on the Vaasan side of the mountains.  The horrid army pushed on, driving hard into Damara and committing one massacre after another.  But the people of Damara were a tough people.  After they recovered from the initial shock of Zhengyi's lightning attacks, they fought back bravely.  For ten brutal years, Vaasa and Damara fought.  Neighboring nations, notably Impiltur and Narfell, looked on with more than passing interest, fearing the shape of their own future if Zhengyi proved victorious.  Yet though they sided with Damara in principle and for practical reasons, the nearby kingdoms of the region had problems of their own.  In turn, they had too many opportunistic neighbors just waiting to gain their own advantage.  Neither Impiltur nor Narfell offered Damara any substantial assistance.  Their paralysis almost cost them dearly.

In the summer of FR1147, Zhengyi's forces faced off against King Virdin at the Ford of Goliad.  Neither side could gain any advantage through the month of June and many thought that the war would hold in stalemate until the next winter, when the river would freeze.  Then came the day that Damarans will ever despise.  No one can say for certain what occurred that foul day, but it seems obvious that treachery led the way for Zhengyi.  Most scholars agree that the scoundrel was Felix, King Virdin's chief lieutenant.  Long afterward Felix was discovered to be a member of the Assassins Guild of the Galenas, Zhengyi's cohorts.  Nothing was suspected at the time. Felix- if it was him- tricked young King Virdin into believing that a magical wand he had acquired would allow the Damaran army secret passage across the river. Actually the 'wand' was a cheap stick stacked with twelve Nystul's magic aura spells.  Virdin desperately grasped at the chance to end the long and costly conflict.  Already aware of the deception, Zhengyi held his forces in check for several tense minutes, coaxing in the Damarans. Then the lich-king struck hard, trapping the bulk of the Damaran army in the river and shattering Virdin's forces.  On a hillock a short distance away, the young king watched his kingdom fall.  His grief ended when a dagger (wielded by Felix?) found its way into his back.

Zhengyi had spent ten years preparing for this day, and he didn't hesitate.  Calling on the forces of the Grandfather of Assassins, the Witch-King instituted the second phase of the destruction of Damara.  It took only one bloody night for the most loyal and powerful nobles of Damara to be slain.  The 'peace' that ensued was not favorable to the conquered.  The Witch-King granted a veneer of independence to the feeble remnants of the Damaran houses, dividing the southern reaches of the old kingdom into six poor baronies; poorer still after paying tribute to their conqueror, the Witch-King. Zhengyi gave control of the Galenas to the Grandfather of Assassins, then tightened his own evil clutch on the north. A stream of refugees trekked south as best they could.  With Damara spiraling into economic ruin and Zhengyi's power growing every day, the neighboring states could only sit tight and hope that the Witch-King would be content with his new domain.~

@650066 = ~History of Dragonspear~
@650067 = ~History of Dragonspear

The builder of the citadel was supposedly a human-dwarf crossbreed who befriended a copper dragon and then built a castle around the lair of the dragon.  A few copper dragons have dwelt in the region, so this part of the story is pretty plausible.  Anyway, the rumors say that this man-dwarf and his dragon scoured the moors to kill orcs, trolls, and other creatures who made their homes there. According to legend, he almost succeeded.  This part of the story has been corroborated, at least in part.  I have seen evidence that, at about the right time in the past to correspond with the story, the trolls and orcs of the region were decimated.  Some goblinkin folklore even indicates that the orcs were completely destroyed at that time.  It was their absence that gave other humanoids the chance to move into the area, along with new tribes of orcs.  Naturally, this wreaked havoc on the ecology of the region for quite some time, and the repercussions are still felt to some degree.

Anyway, the castle's builder died not long after he wrecked the ecology of the High Moor, and the castle was then ruined by a wizard.  This wizard also set up the first gate within Dragonspear that allowed baatezu to come to this plane.  As one might imagine, this again radically changed the local ecology.  Baatezu are avid hunters and are quite organized.  Fortunately, their appetites lead them to people as prey, so the normal inhabitants of the High Moor were able to adapt fairly readily to the presence of the baatezu, at least as far as I can tell.

Dragonspear for centuries has then served as a marshaling center for various groups including lizard men, ophidians, and a large variety of goblinkin.  Baatezu, though rare, have become a part of the local ecology.  Magical items from the ruin have also escaped on occasion to make things interesting.  Trolls, goblinkin, and human brigands still lurk in the castle. While the gate is supposedly neutralized, or at least guarded, baatezu still linger in the area.

@650068 = ~History of Netheril's First Age~
@650069 = ~History of Netheril's First Age

Netheril's history began nearly 5,000 years ago at the site of seven fishing villages during the time of the First Flowering.  Those who follow Dalereckoning would place the date at -3859 DR, but to the Netherese, it was the dawn of the new age.  Within a scant few decades, the citizens of the fishing villages of Fenwick, Gers, Gilan, Gustaf, Moran, Nauseef, and Janick referred to the years as NY, which stood for Netheril Years (unless otherwise noted, all years past this point are in Netheril Years).  The birth of Netheril was known as the First Age, lasting up until the year 326 NY.  The villages had made the decision to band together for mutual protection against marauding orc bands.  The shaman king of Gers, called Nether the Elder, created a calendar to celebrate the union.  The coalition of villages was named Seventon, since the marriage of seven villages created the newfound nation. Great joy reigned through Seventon, the people celebrating both their first steps toward civilization and the wisdom of their leaders.  A few years later, however, King Nether renamed the kingdom Netheril? which meant Nether's Land. He demanded more and more tribute from the united villages, and many feared that Seventon would collapse.  The citizens from the united villages cried out in protest, and the future for the kingdom began to look very dim.

A poisoned dirk signaled the end of Nether the Elder's reign, however, and a strong and just successor-Nether the Younger-stepped in to take control.  No one ever learned who held the lethal blade, and frankly, no one was really in any hurry to find out.  The stress of living under a tyrannical and egotistical leader fell away, and the people lived in peace once again, free to concentrate on trade.  The nation's name, however, stood the test of time.

The Netherese chose a new form of government-one based loosely on democracy.  They had a single king whose surviving firstborn was destined to take the place of the elder, but the leaders of each village had a single vote.  The vote of the king was worth five votes, however, giving him more political clout than any single leader.  Fourteen years after the formation of Netheril, the Earlanni elves approached the loosely tied villages.  Until this time, elves were a mere myth-imaginary creatures sent by the gods to lend a hand and redirect erred humans to the correct path.  Netheril bowed its head in awe to these "messengers of the earth spirits" and venerated them.  It took several years for the elves to convince these scarcely civilized humans that they were mortals.  With this accomplished, the elves established trade with Netheril beginning a friendship that lasted for centuries.

One of the many things the elves traded was magic.  Nether the Younger's friend, Therion Gers, was the first Netherese to learn this new trade.  After one year of tutelage in the ways of cantras (0-level spells), he cast a spell to start a campfire.  Two years later, the community considered the first human arcanist  (Netheril's name for a wizard) the third-most-important person in their society, under Nether the Young and Spirit-Summoner the shaman.  The people changed the mage's name to Therion the First of Gers, since he was the first arcanist of Netheril.

For the next century, trade continued with the elves, and magic use in this small nation grew in leaps and bounds.  Unlike many other cultures, magic use was considered essential, and everyone who turned the age of ascension (13 summers) was taught the ways of magic.~

@650070 = ~History of Tethyr~
@650071 = ~Ten Black Days of Eleint

The Ten Black Days of Eleint, now a score of years past, shall forever remind nobles in Tethyr and the whole Realms of the fate that awaits those who abuse their power and influence over others.  According to the few surviving nobles of that period, some were aware of such unrest among the people, but mostly those from the border states around the Forest of Tethir who suffered the brunt of the elves' wrath during the Hunts.

Among the dukes and other nobles under Alemander IV, only two- the dukes of Dusk and Suretmarch- were seen as utter tyrants, though others were harsh to their workers and vassal counts. While the unrest among the highlanders seems justified, it hardly explains the vicious uprisings in the lowlands.  According to a number of diviners and priests who spoke with many exhumed parties, the hysteria that gripped many folk during these times came from on high, though which gods may have been responsible is unclear.  Some sources point to the Banite clergies that were numerous around Tethyr at that time, while others mention the dark god of destruction Talos and his minions.  An even wilder legend that those in County Uluran hold true suggests that the vengeance of the elves' gods forced many peasants to rise up against their overlords in retribution for the torment they visited upon the Tel'Quessir. One story isolated to the village of Toralth mentioned a black cloud with red eyes descending upon the village (Malar's mark), which turned villagers and local elves into ravaging hunters of the nobles.

Of all the varied tales of gods and priests rallying marauders from the villages all about Tethyr, only one can be traced to a particular known person: Dlatha Faenar, a priestess of Beshaba.  A number of accounts link her to a visit at the camp of General Sharboneth the night before the attack on Castle Tethyr.  She was also seen on the ramparts of the castle the night it fell.  Her exact actions and involvement with the fall of Tethyr are unknown, and she cannot be approached at the Spires against the Stars for questioning.  Still, the interest of the Maid of Misrule and her deadly but beauteous servant is not unfitting, as the luck of both traitor-tyrants ran out that night.  One possible explanation for the destruction of so much could be a former power-play by either Myrkul or Bhaal to upset the tyrannical power of Bane in the area by rallying aid from the worshipers (if not the god itself) of Malar, Beshaba, and their own assassins.  By destroying the tyrants of Bane, their own power would grow; however, the plan seemed to fail as Bane's tyranny only gained a further grip through lesser, more grasping and greedy hands during the unrest.  The Ten Black Days- the 13th through the 22nd day of Eleint in the Year of the Bright Blade (1347 DR)- brought down eight entire noble families, four of Tethyr's larger castles, and six temples (to Bane, Bhaal, Helm, Lathander, Mystra, and Oghma).  It caused the deaths of more than 600 other people with ties to the royalty, such as guards and servants.  Once Castle Tethyr burned to the ground, the mobs seemed to spring up and spread out in all directions from its smoking ruins.  No place was safe if the mobs believed it harbored anyone of noble birth.

Within two days, the Piirlons of Zazesspur (Queen Rhinda's family), the Sakhars of Myratma (the royalty's main merchant arm and cousins to the king), and the western branch of the Riiklass clan (the family of Princess-Consort Dhara) in the Purple Hills were murdered by mobs.  It was later discovered that the nine Riiklass nobles were innocent traders and metalsmiths.  Four days after the king's death, only two counts remained in their seats of power, under siege in western Tethyr (though they too fell by the end of the Black Days). Lord Tuvos 'The Rune Count' Akasi, the wizard ruler of the area called Monrativi Teshy Mir, died in a spell-battle that also destroyed his castle and acres of surrounding greenery. His slayers were the members of Tethyr's  adventuring company of wizards, the Magis Mir, who disappeared seven months later from their refuge in the Forest of Mir.  The abusive taskmaster Count Romar Miklaas of the Purple Hills died at the hands of longsuffering halfling tenants and their druid allies on his own manorial lands.  The Sixth Day saw the greatest destruction and the widest exodus of nobles, as mobs set torches to many of the noble villas and manors in and around Ithmong.  While 12 families of lesser or now-unseated nobles escaped to Riatavin or parts farther north, others died at the hands of the mobs.  Four wagons, complete with the entire remaining noble families of the Mir Protectorate, tried to exit to the north through Survale Ford; they thought they were traveling incognito, but a bribed servant betrayed them.  The mob caught up with the escapees and the carriages were forced off the Helmbridge and into the raging River Ith, where all aboard drowned.  The rich cattle ranches north of Ithmong and Myratma were looted and set aflame, and the night was commemorated as the Night of Nine Fires, as the burning manors were visible for miles around.  The remaining four Black Days saw confused manhunts throughout the country with paranoid mobs still raging about the cities and the  countryside.  Many were murdered as they tried but ultimately failed to protect children hidden among them who happened to be of noble birth.  In the eastern highlands, the clans held firm to their clan loyalties, but they simply held the chaos in check in small areas, as did the duchy of Elestam to the east.  By the end of this period, over 550 nobles had been killed, and the toll among the commoners ran to 1,700, due to out-of-control fires or mercenary soldiers defending their lords.

Of the 56 seated nobles (and over 100 titled lesser nobles) that ruled before the 13th day of Eleint, only two dukes, one count, and five barons survived to the end of the Black Days within Tethyr.  They were spared either by luck, fear, or their natures as kind, just masters whose people came to their defense.  All the rest either died or fled the country, though some heirs stayed behind to hold onto their family's power.  Lord Nivedann Illehhune, the heir and tyrant duke of Dusk just like his father, marshalled his forces (including three of the surviving vassal barons) around him and held out against a protracted siege that finally led to the destruction of his castle and the duke's death in Mirtul of the Year of the Crown (1351DR).  Of the three barons, Lord Erktos Kytolamn of Valshall and Banite Lord Challas Barstonn of Shelshyr died while trying to flee Tethyr a year into the siege (though some say they died on orders of Duke Illehhune, who confiscated their money and equipment to fight the siege).  The last official baron of Tethyr, Nivedann's uncle Lord Maxos Illehhune of Cyvann Hills, died with his nephew during the final siege attacks.  (Lord Hhune is a distant relative of this family.)  Count Vartan Thrynnar of Alonmarch took many of his tenant farmers into their castle for protection, and his loyal troops broke the first of many small sieges against them.  Until the Reclamation, however, Lord Thrynnar was only able to control and defend roughly half of his county from the marauding peasants and power-mongers.  Baron Amir Raslemtar, though he survived, fled Tethyr with his family for their continued safety, not trusting on blind luck to see him through the years ahead. In good faith, the mob that had hours before executed his overlords the Duke of Ankramir and the Count of Bashyrvale provided him and his family safe escort to a ship heading north to Baldur's Gate.  The final surviving baron, Lord Dinos Akhmelere of Kirgrove, fled with a caravan of his possessions along the Trade Way in hopes of settling safely in Esmeltaran, but he never arrived at his family's lesser holdings in Amn.  Elmanesse elves today say that 'the great hunter of elves was dealt with according to his own actions,' but add nothing more.  The last duke of Tethyr's easternmost duchy of Elestam, Lord Valon Morann, held his borders firm with loyal troops to prevent any of his corrupt neighbors from fleeing to him for help.  Within two months of the Black Days, the duchy seceded entirely from Tethyr after ousting four corrupt barons and counts and their families, as they were more loyal to their despot neighbor the Duke of Dusk.~

@650072 = ~History of the Dark Wars~
@650073 = ~History of the Dark Wars

The warlike drow nature did not change when they escaped their surface foes.  They immediately launched a series of wars to establish territories in the Underdark.  They began by stealing and seizing dwarven magical items, and using them against the dwarves; establishing an enmity that is still strong today.  The drow then fought among themselves, noble against noble, priest against priestess, for rule of their new realm.  This all-out war ended amid great magical explosions that brought down the roof of the largest dwarven cavern they had seized, great Bhaerynden. The ceiling collapsed entirely, burying many drow and the shattered dwarven cities. The cavern, now open to the sky, became. known as The Great Rift.  The surviving drow nobles gathered what people,slaves, and equipment they could seize, and fled into the Underdark in search of places to dwell. "The Scattering" brought about the many rival, self-interested cities where most drow live today.~

@650074 = ~History of the Great Glacier~
@650075 = ~History of the Great Glacier

In the beginning, there was an ocean.  A millennium ago, when the Realms were barren, a vast ocean filled the area now known as the Great Glacier, spilling south to the lands that would eventually become Vaasa, Damara, and Narfell.  The ocean was still and uninviting; even if seafaring vessels had existed then, explorers would have found little of interest in its icy waters.

Ulutiu, however, found the ocean irresistible.  It isn't known if it was the solitude that attracted him, or if its bitter temperatures invigorated him. Perhaps he felt an affinity with the aquatic creatures that thrived in its depths. Whatever the reason, once Ulutiu discovered the ocean, he never left it.  As for Ulutiu himself, he remains a mystery.  From the writings he left behind, it is clear that he wasn't human, at least not in the accepted sense.  He may have been an avatar of the gods, or an entity from another world seeking refuge in the Realms for reasons unknown. In any case, he wielded powerful magic- stronger perhaps, than any magic wielded by the most skilled wizards of the Realm before or since.

By all accounts, Ulutiu enjoyed a life of peaceful reflection, avoiding involvement in the affairs of men or gods.  He spent his days in a magically-constructed barge of ice, endlessly drifting in the waters he adored.  When the end of his life approached, it was no surprise that Ulutiu chose the ocean as his final resting place.  To prepare for his death, he fashioned a necklace of enchanted ice, a delicate chain of glistening blue crystals that would ensure a peaceful afterlife on the ocean floor.  On his last day, Ulutiu lay down on his barge, then donned the necklace, activating its magic.  As life ebbed from his body, the necklace began to glow, covering Ulutiu in a frosty glaze that expanded and grew, encasing the entire barge in a tomb of magical ice.  The barge sank under the weight of the ice, coming to rest on the ocean floor thousands of feet below.  Unfortunately, the magic of the necklace worked too well. The ice tomb continued to grow, chilling the waters around it, creating huge mountains of ice that towered above the hardening surface to pierce the clouds.  Many years later, when the magic had reached its limit, the vast ocean was no more.  In its place was a sprawling arctic wasteland.  The Great Glacier was born.

Beneath it all, buried below tons of ice and snow, lay the corpse of Ulutiu, the glowing necklace still draped around his neck.  He lies there today, undisturbed, forgotten.  For the sake of the peoples of the Great Glacier, as well as those in the lands to the south, it is hoped that his rest continues.  If the necklace of Ulutiu were removed, the enchantment would be broken, and the Great Glacier would surely begin to melt.~

@650076 = ~History of Netheril's Golden Age~
@650077 = ~History of Netheril's Golden Age

The time of the Chronomancer's birth in 1652NY marks the beginning of Netheril's Golden Age, when the nation was at the very pinnacle of its power.  Netheril began lifting one enclave into the sky per year.  Soon, dozens of these magnificent monoliths of magic rode the air currents or moved in orbital patterns around the loosely defined borders of the Netheril empire.  Each archwizard who created his enclave heeded Ioulaum's example, setting up his or her own laws and guidelines that the enclave's residents had to follow.  As time went on, the people had less and less say, and their voice regarding changes in government, tax rates, and the such were drowned out by the archwizards' lust for more power.  The enclaves soon became a vehicle to provide funding for the archwizards' spell research, a staging area for campaigns against other archwizards, and excursions into the quasi- and para-elemental planes.

The Chronomancer was concerned about the other human civilizations on Faerûn.  He felt that Netheril's snobbery toward less-magically developed nations was a mistake that would come back and haunt the empire.  While the Chronomancer shared many of the archwizards' weaknesses (such as the belief that the gods were just powerful archwizards who could be challenged), he also cared about the well-being of Netheril's neighbors.  This included the elves, dwarves, and barbarian peoples.  When news of an orc horde ravaging the Illusk nation in 1756NY reached his ears, he entered the fray, helping the human settlements fend off the attack.  Unfortunately, even the incredible power of the Chronomancer couldn't save the nation, and he fell victim to a degenerative wound that killed him eight years later.  He very well could have taken healing and curative spells to fix his ailment, but, like all of Netheril archwizards, he believed the gods were merely archwizards like himself who had found "ultimate magic."  Their pride wouldn't allow them to put their faith in the deities for fear if they put their trust in these advanced archwizards, they would never achieve "ultimate magic" themselves.

Netheril was never without some rising menace, and the archwizards had to spend a lot of time dealing with enemies from both the surface world and from within their own ranks.  This included destructive acts by Netherese citizens as well as the nonhumans that swarmed around and within Netheril's borders.  In the year 1963NY, Netheril bore witness to an enternal menace: citizens who had little aptitude or respect for magic.  Nine men broke into the "Most Holy and Magical Chamber of Ioulaum the Demidivine," killing nine guards in the process and losing seven of their numbers, to steal 24 parts of the Nether Scrolls.  When the thieves escaped to the surface world, a manhunt began.  The thieves, fearful of the archwizard's retribution, pounded the priceless golden scrolls into indiscernible baubles.  They then sold these gold nuggets, receiving about 260 gp in coins.

In 2201NY, the Mines of Dekanter were plundered to their fullest.  Nothing more could be mined from this site, and Netheril abandoned it.  However, the Mines of Dekanter were reopened three years later in order to accommodate the creation and research of dangerous spells- all because of one incident: the destruction of a flying city.

-----------------------------------------
The First Falling

The first enclave fell in 2202NY, when the floating city of Sunrest yielded to the effects of ill-planned spell research.  The city hailed the impending creation of a spell called the Sunrest Sunshock (which was an early attempt at an ultra-powerful meteor swarm spell), but an accident occurred.  The spell probably worked correctly, especially when eyewitness accounts from the city of Remembrance reported a blinding flash of light from the west, with a deafening roar that followed a few minutes later.  Those who watched were horrified to see the whole enclave fall to the ground into a heap of rubble and stone.  No one survived the accident.

-----------------------------------------
The Barbarian Schism

In an unprecedented move, the Angardt tribes living near Frostypaw befriended an arcanist from Netheril who began teaching them spellcraft in 2477NY.  The arcanist wanted to help the Angardt fend off orc raiding parties, and the tribesmen were eager to learn new techniques to rid themselves of the murderous hordes.  Unfortunately, the nearby Rengarth tribe, fearful of magic, drove the Angardt from their homeland.  For seven years, the Rengarth battled Angardt tribesmen that chose to stay until all of the magic-following tribe was well away from their lands.~

@650078 = ~History of Undermountain~
@650079 = ~History of Undermountain

Tales tell of a wizard who came to the mountain in ages past to make his home in isolation from the societies of men.  Some say Halaster Blackcloak came from Netheril, others from the east.  Still others hold that he hailed from the Cradlelands, vanished human kingdoms now buried beneath Raurin and The Plains of Purple Dust.  All these lands and their peoples are said to have populated both Faerun and Kara-Tur in the dim, dust-shrouded past.  The wizard's name is even a matter of dispute: Halaster is sometimes called 'Hilather' in old texts.  Elminster's researches indicate that Hilather is the Mad Wizard's given name, while the grander 'Halaster' was the name he took for himself as a powerful wizard.  Halaster is said to have started the traditions of holding Magefairs each decade (and the smaller, annual Spellmoots) in remote, everchanging locations in the Realms.  He is also said to have devised many powerful spells, and perfected some processes and items now widely known and used in wizardly circles.

Whatever the truth about Halaster's origins, the stories all tell the same story of his later years.  He suddenly left off all dealings with men over a thousand years ago, and came to Mount Waterdeep to make his home,  accompanied by seven apprentices.  Halaster summoned and bound fell creatures from other planes to build a traditional wizard's tower, ringed with a stout stone rampart enclosing an extensive garden, paddock, and warehouses.  The Seven, as the apprentices are named in historical texts, worked the fields, dwelling in lesser turrets along the inside of the ring-wall. They continued their magical studies but saw their Dread Master little.  Halaster's dealings with his summoned servitors changed him.  The more Halaster avoided human contact and dealt with otherplanar creatures, the stranger he became.  He grew grim, given to long silences, sudden rages, and erratic behavior.  He had his creatures dig storage caves, additional laboratories, and long exit-tunnels beneath his tower.  This work went on for decades.

At length, the tunnels broke into the old dwarven delvings called the Underhalls, once home to the long-vanished Melairkyn clan (only a fading memory, even then).  The Underhalls were large and grand, built to the scale of tall men rather than dwarves. They guarded two ancient mithril-mines known as The Seadeeps, which extended far beneath Mount Waterdeep.  The mountain itself was known to dwarves of old as Mount Melairbode, named after the dwarf who first explored it and found mithril.  His descendants became the clan Melairkyn; in the end, the clan members all died or were scattered by duergar and drow from the depths of Abeir-Toril.  The Underhalls became the lairs for the duergar and the dark elves, in residence still when Halaster found his way into the deep ways.  As soon as the mithril was worked out,the duergar moved on.  In the days of the Fallen Kingdom, most of the drow were slaughtered in vicious battles with surface elves.  Halaster himself is thought to have eradicated the last organized remnants of The Dark Folk.  The Seven wrote often in diaries of their Master's increasingly dangerous expeditions against the drow- the phrase 'Halaster's Hunt' still retains its meaning as a 'berserk raid or wilful slaughter' in the North today.  The Seven also hint at some captured drow being transformed and enslaved into Halaster's service.

With the drow gone or magically twisted into grotesque servant-creatures, Halaster banished his summoned slaves to their home planes and moved entirely into the subterranean ways, abandoning his tower to the elements.  His curious apprentices, upon exploring the tower, found only traps awaiting them, baited with powerful magics and enigmatic messages hinting that 'true power' awaited them below.  One by one, as their courage and capabilities took them, the Seven went below in search of their Master.  They found a strange, labyrinthine, and dangerous world awaiting them.  Halaster stored his treasures, experiments, victuals and neccessities, magical items, and servants in these under-ways.  Here, he thought himself safe from prying intrusions, theft and attacks by thieves, hostile brigands of all sorts, as well as his sorcerous foes.  Halaster sent his guardian creatures and traps against the Seven, testing both his students and the defenses of his new underground home.  After the deaths of two lesser apprentices, Halaster stopped the attacks and enlisted his students' help to add to the 'security' of his underground realm.  Halaster reworked his defensive barrier- spells to allow his apprentices limited access to areas of Undermountain by the use of the horned rings.  The lone apprentice who survived her descent into Undermountain and returned to the surface Realms broke away from her master and fled the area.  Jhesiyra Kestellharp went east to Myth Drannor and eventually became the Magister.  The Realms gained what little it does know about Halaster from her writings.

The other apprentices either perished or went insane living within the mad Halaster's dungeon.  Since the abandonment of his surface tower, the settlement that became Waterdeep grew a stone's throw below Halaster's Hold, along the edge of the harbor.  It wasn't long before intrepid adventurers discovered Halaster's tower and the initial entrances to the dungeons beneath.  As time passed, Halaster and his apprentices encountered an increasing number of exploratory expeditions by armed adventurers within his subterranean lair.  Halaster's preoccupation with his dark stronghold allegedly affected his mind, and he used the halls and numerous magical gates to give free rein to his rather curious hobbies of roaming various planes and collecting monsters.  He enlisted these monsters to further defend the upper levels of his halls.  The upper levels were then abandoned from use except as a glorified? killing gallery for intruders.  Halaster moved his own dwelling and laboratories ever deeper into the vast and endless darkness.  Deep in the bowels of Faerun, Halaster grew to be a great and terrible old man who dabbled in magics that buy immortality.  To continue his work relatively unmolested, he created a double, or clone, of himself quite late in life, infected it with the wasting disease (leprosy), and let it die where it would be found by patrols from Waterdeep. Roaming the halls of Undermountain, he amused himself by watching parties of thieves, wanderers, soldiers of fortune, and magical rivals fall afoul of his gathered monsters and the clever death-traps he had devised.  He found humor where many found comfort in the mistaken belief that he was dead and they could pillage the wizard's dungeons unopposed.

No one in Waterdeep or Undermountain today is positive if Halaster still lives or is dead.  Many who venture deep into Undermountain believe he lives on.  They say he watches from the walls, walks the lowest levels, and is vastly amused by the pain, suffering, deeds, and deaths of intruders.  Sometimes, he aids those who are lost by providing a single lit torch, or a dagger clattering down from overhead; often accompanied by a human skull as a grim warning.  He indulges the whims of his cruel humor by playing tricks, manipulating explorers like puppets on a stage.

-----------------------------------------
Waterdeep and deeper...

When Halaster first arrived, Waterdeep was no more than a natural harbor to the west of his tower.  People soon settled here, the site a natural trading port and easy stop along the trade routes to the south.  As time progressed, Waterdeep grew beyond a simple settlement and became a great city.  With it grew the tales and legends of the lairs under the city.

Undermountain became known as a place of horrors, the labyrinthine lair of many terrible monsters.  The burgeoning city swallowed and built over the ruins of the surface Hold; its citizens now tunnelled the Mount and its flanks for its sewers, hidden ways, and castle dungeons.  In many places, the growing city met the older, darker Undermountain and avoided or embraced its presence.  It became a habit of certain Lords of Waterdeep to free troublesome miscreants from their dungeon cells in Castle Waterdeep and send them down into the largely unexplored passages of Undermountain.  These actions were by no means the only ways the City of Splendors used its nefarious underrealms, but they directly led to Undermountain's infamy across Faerun and its (probably false) title as 'the deepest dungeon of them all.'

One of the first to walk Undermountain and emerge to tell the tale was a warrior named Durnan.  He survived to return to the surface and tear down the remnants of Halaster's tower, long since shattered by wizards' battles and other fell magic.  Atop its rubble, he built his inn.  It was a good spot for trade close to the docks, and Durnan made a good living outfitting and provisioning those who journeyed down to explore the depths. He encouraged local priests of Tymora to heal those who dared the dangers of Undermountain for nominal fees.  Durnan and others who returned from the Great Below spoke of riches and dangers, both in large  measure, and of the vast size of the underways.  Many others, for whatever reasons of their own; perhaps they became bored or desperate for riches, adventured on bets or were hiding from foes or authorities; went down the shafts in Durnan's inn, The Yawning Portal.

Criminals once lived in the dungeon willingly: the Thieves' Guild of Waterdeep had a citadel within the craggy slopes of Mount Waterdeep.  Located in an 'upper level' of Undermountain thick with traps, guardians, secret passages, and peepholes, the Guild managed to secure their citadel from the roving monsters set loose by Halaster.  For its time, this trap-filled area was known as The Citadel of the Bloody Hand, named after the professional name of the Guildmaster.  The guild was later driven out of the city, but it was not known if the Lords now controlled the former citadel of the Guild.  If it was destroyed or if it lay deserted was a question best asked of and answered by the roaming monsters who quickly returned to inhabit the vast dungeon ways.  Besides Durnan, others return from the Realms' "deepest dungeon" and make good with the wealth and adventure they find there.

Mirt 'the Moneylender' has walked Undermountain's ways in times past, and has come forth richer to tell the tale.  Mirt is widely (and correctly) thought in the city to be one of the Lords of Waterdeep, and does little adventuring these days outside of the taproom of a good tavern.  He remembers his adventuring days fondly, however, and his trade-symbol (a wolf's head surrounded by a dragon chasing its own tail) is found on the doorposts and awnings of many shops selling weaponry and adventuring gear in Waterdeep.  It is a point of pride that any shop supplied by Mirt will never run out of torches, daggers, or 200'-long coils of rope.~

@650080 = ~History of the Founding~
@650081 = ~History of the Founding

Five thousand years ago, the city was founded here by a great high priestess of Lloth, Menzoberra the Kinless (so-named because she had no surviving family), who had fled from the great drow city of Golothaer. Golothaer was busily destroying itself in civil war, between drow faithful to the Spider Queen, Lloth, and those who worshipped Ghaunadaur.  As warring priestesses turned foes to spiders or entombed them beneath tons of shifting rock, drow mages hurled spells to summon gigantic purple worms to devour their opponents, made huge, many-roomed inhabited stalactites break loose from cavern ceilings to crash down on dwellings below, and caused great cracks to open up in the solid rock, to swallow drow armies and the fortresses they issued from.  All over Golothaer there was great death and destruction, no safety or peace or happiness, and in the end, no hope of survival.

The proud and powerful priestess of Lloth, Menzoberra, alone of her sister high priestesses, turned away from the fray.  She gathered seven families of wealth and power, telling them she was following the will of Lloth, and bade them accompany her to found a new city loyal to Lloth.

Leaving the chaos of war-torn Golothaer, Menzoberra's band set forth into the unknown, trusting to Lloth's guidance.  They traveled a long, long time through the Underdark, fighting off many fearsome monsters, and braving the perils of waterfalls, cave-ins, and rockslides in the everpresent darkness.  Whenever the band seemed lost, or about to perish from hunger or at the hands of a foe, Lloth sent aid; many easily-slain giant cave bats for easily-gotten food; or a spider leading them on by a hidden route out of an apparent waterless dead-end; or a timely cave-in, bringing down a cave-ceiling atop illithids on the verge of overwhelming the weary drow band.

For all of Lloth's aid, the road was long and hard, and none of Menzoberra's band could have found the way back to ruined Golothaer if they had wanted to.~

@650083 = ~War of the Hart:

Several weeks after the Great Glacier swallowed Voninheim, Annam's last son finally freed himself from Othea's lifeless womb. Somehow, the instant he emerged, he immediately understood his destiny and set about reviving Ostoria.  Known as Hartkiller (his first action was killing and eating a deer), the young king parlayed with the giant tribes descended from each of his brothers in turn, asking for their assistance.  To his amazement, he was rejected by them all.  Born a runt (only 12 feet tall), Hartkiller had a difficult time convincing his brothers that he was Annam's chosen ruler.

Unwilling to turn his back on his destiny, Hartkiller turned to each of the scattered segments of humans that lived on the fringe of the Endless Ice Sea.  If the giants were unwilling to help rebuild his father's kingdom, then perhaps mankind would oblige.  In exchange for their fealty, Hartkiller promised to help the humans drive the giants out of the valley known as Hartsvale to establish a glorious kingdom free from the threat of the giants and their pillage.

At first, the humans were somewhat reluctant to accept the proposal.  But after Hartkiller's half brothers, the giant-kin, rallied together to stand at Hartkiller's side against the giants, a call to arms was issued, sparking off the so-called War of the Hart.

Ultimately, Hartkiller did force the giants to leave the Valley and begrudgingly respect the territory of his kingdom.  Today, this kingdom- Hartsvale- enjoys close ties with some of the giant tribes that once occupied its lands.~

@650084 = ~History of the Harpers~
@650085 = ~History of the Harpers

The roots of the Harpers of today can be found in the beginnings of Myth Drannor, when the wise ruler of the elven realm of Cormanthor realized that humans were too numerous, adaptable, persistent, and skilled to ignore or defeat.  He decided that welcoming them was the best policy for the elven race.  By the time the Mythal was laid and the city of Myth Drannor opened for dwarves, gnomes, halflings, humans, elves, and their various half-breeds to dwell together (DR 261, the Year of Soaring Stars), there was an active policy of promoting friendship between the races.  Good people of all races worked against evil folk and rebels such as the Starym elven family, whose deeds might shatter the delicate peace between the races.

The most experienced elven generals, in consultation with the most trusted of the human rangers and druids they'd invited into their realm, determined that a secret organization was needed to work for the causes of good.  Not a band loyal to any ruler, for that way leads inevitably to oppression and self-interested intrigue, but a band of 'friends of freedom' who could work secretly, outside laws and politics, to put down evil.  An idealistic and powerful elven mage, who took the name 'Lady Steel,' agreed to head this band, making decisions with the help of a council of elven elders and three humans, of whom one was a young adventuring mage known as Elminster.

Lady Steel's common name was Dathlue Mistwinter; she was the last living member of an old elven family whose symbol was a silver harp between the horns of a silver crescent moon, surrounded by a circle of stars, on a black background.  The band of human, elven, and half-elven warriors, mages, rangers, druids, and even a few thieves took this badge as their own.  Since they met at twilight in hidden places deep in the Elven Court wood, guided by the sounds of a lone harper once they'd drawn near a known landmark, they became known as "the Harpers at Twilight."  From the very start, there were more female than male Harpers, and their ranks included folk from all walks of life.  They shared a love of nature and freedom- and enough inner fire to fight for such things.  Orcs, cruel mages of all races who dabbled in experimentation on intelligent beings, brigands (especially those large and well-armed bands aided or led by elves unfriendly to humans), and slavers were the chief foes of the Harpers.  There were many nasty encounters in the woods as the years passed and Myth Drannor grew in wealth and power, attracting the unscrupulous (mainly humans from the South, but also subterranean evil races such as the drow and illithids) to its vicinity.  Down the years, the Harpers fought on, growing fewer at the hands of their foes- but certain watching eyes approved of what they did.  Their aims were essentially the same as those of the Harpers of today.  They worked against tyrants of all races and faiths, aiding those in need and even trying to settle local feuds and grudges, to foster peace among all.

Then came the dark time of Myth Drannor's fall, when tanar'ri roamed the Dragonreach lands, thrones fell, and the rule of the sword returned as desperate folk fought each other for the crumbling remnants of shattered realms.  Lady Steel perished fighting Myth Drannor's attackers, torn apart limb from limb even as her spells claimed the lives of her slayers.  Spell contingencies triggered by her death caused her body to destruct in a magical explosion that slew more of her enemies.

She was not the only Harper to die that day.  Few survived the months that followed, fighting openly for the first time to protect the folk they'd watched over.  The power of the elves was broken forever in Faerun.  From this point on, their races were in a steady decline on the continent.  At the same time, a new wave of human invasion and settlement came from the South.  The lands around the Inner Sea (particularly the Vilhon Reach) have always been fertile and over-populated, sending forth periodic waves of explorers seeking their fortunes elsewhere in the Realms, as things become too crowded.  Unlike the orcs, who do the same thing in the North, sweeping south in vast raiding hordes whenever overcrowding makes them restless (usually about once a decade), these men came to settle.  With them they brought all the concerns and doings of men in the Old Empires; including the cruel faiths of evil gods, often driven out of their warmer homelands by their fearful neighbors.  These included those who worshipped Bane, Bhaal, Loviatar, and Myrkul, and these decadent faiths joined the followers of Malar, the Lord of the Hunt, in the ranks of priesthoods that are violent in the North.  These priesthoods moved swiftly to consolidate power in the developing Dragonreach.  Their cruelties shocked the elves who'd not yet withdrawn westward to Evereska.  They called together what they could of their folk and began training all their younglings in the arts of war (notably in encampments around the shores of Lake Sember, and in the thickly wooded area known as isthe Tangletreesls).  They also founded a trading center- Elventree- where they could meet with other races.  In an unprecedented act, they contacted certain other human priesthoods, asking for a secret meeting.

-----------------------------------------
At the Dancing Place

The meeting was convened in a remote spot that could be defended from attack- a wooded hill in the High Dale known as 'the Dancing Place' because korreds had once dwelt there in numbers.  The human druids who lived there now were astonished when a score of dryads appeared from trees all over their hill.  These bid the druids make welcome the priests of other faiths who would come.  Dusk came early that day, and a moon rose bright and full and clear on a night when no moon should have shone.  It was four nights before Midsummer in the Year of the Dawn Rose (720 DR).  The frightened druids saw a strange assortment of folk come to them, some riding winged horses, others stepping out of empty air, and still others trudging up the mountain passes with well-worn staves and weary feet.  When the assembly was complete, the druids of Silvanus saw that clergy of Deneir, Eldath, Lliira, Mielikki, Milil, Mystra, Oghma, Selune, Tymora and the elven gods had gathered on their hill.  A certain irascible mage by the name of Elminster stepped out onto the height and spoke of why the elves had called for this parley.  They wanted the support of the priests gathered here for 'a shadowy band of heroes' that would work against those who served the Cruel Gods, before all lands were plunged into war and slavery and tyranny, and no man or elf would dare trust his neighbor.  A band who would work against any realm that grew too large and proud to respect its neighbors, or tend the trees and the beasts they shared the land with.  A band serving no one lord or god, but with the quiet support of many, so that those whose tastes did not run to armies and the lash of the tyrant could fight back against the rule of the sword.  None of the priests were much used to working with others, and none liked to give in on any matter without the direct guidance of their deities, for fear of displeasing those they worshiped.  The debate began coldly, and soon grew hot.  The mood of the gathering changed to awe, however, when manifestations made it clear to all that some of the deities represented on that hill were interested enough to take control of their followers, and speak directly through them. Before long, the frightened faces of mortals stared at each other in the moonlight as all the gods involved dealt with each other through them.  The lips and hands of the priests moved to divine will.  Such a gathering of godly power has not been seen on the face of Faerûn in mortal memory since, even at the end of the Time of Troubles, in the air above Waterdeep.  Some priests aged years that night from the powers that coursed through them.  Not a few were changed utterly, or twisted in their wits, by the bald knowledge of what certain deities believed;or thought of their mortal servants.  In the end, the gathered gods agreed to support an organization that worked for all of them and served none of them.  Each god gave of his or her divine power, that certain of these Harpers would be able to call on their divine blessing as a reward for work, and to enable them to accomplish greater tasks. (This is the origin of the special powers granted to Master Harpers, and why they are referred to as 'blessings.')  The belief that sick creatures who sleep overnight in the Dancing Place will be healed- and given a mission or task by the gods to boot- dates from this time. (For beings who worship the deities listed, and woodland beings watched over by Mielikki and Silvanus, this legend is true).  The meeting also encouraged the human settlement of the High Dale (cynics say control of the mountain passes played a greater role, but Elminster merely smiled at that and murmured, 'Harper control of the passes, please').  The High Dale's badge is is the High Harp because of this meeting, too.  To preserve the safety of the folk of the dale, the Harpers have avoided locating agents or a stronghold there, preferring instead to establish concealed caches of food, gear, healing potions, and other magic in mountain caves nearby. 
(It is also likely that the treaty with Cormyr that keeps one war wizard always watching over the dale, with the promise of defending it in time of war, was arranged by a Harper agent in the Royal Court of Cormyr.  As one of the oldest surviving treaties of the present ruling family of Cormyr, the terms of this agreement are proudly and diligently carried out, even today.)~

The year 326NY marked one of the most important dates in Netheril's history- the discovery of the nether scrolls.  This set of 100 scrolls provided the Netherese with an incredible jump in spellcraft unseen in the history of Toril.  This was an age of tremendous learning in Netheril that lasted until the birth of its greatest archwizards.

The person responsible for unearthing these vital pieces of magical lore was unknown; he's referred to as Finder.  While searching the area west of the Far Horns Forest, Finder ran across an ancient ruined building that appeared to have been inhabited by a race who utilized the walls as well as the floor.  The chairs and utilitarian furnishings seemed to indicate the species possessed more than two legs-possibly four.  Finder searched every nook and cranny in this old, dilapidated building, hoping to find something of value to sell when he reached home.  When he discovered the gold scrolls, he realized he had found something worth far beyond the scrolls' monetary value.  He returned the scrolls to Netheril and studied them incessantly.

Finder discovered that the 100 gold pages were actually two sets of 50 scrolls.  One set looked much older and tarnished than the other.  He called the gold foils the nether scrolls, named after the nation of his birth, and shared his newfound information with the arcanists of Seventon and Zenith a few years later.  Within a few short decades, everyone in Netheril was blessed with the knowledge contained in the scrolls.~

@650088 = ~History of the Battle of Bones~
@650089 = ~History of the Battle of Bones

The Year of the Spreading Spring was regarded merely as a year with a short rainy season and an unpleasantly  warm summer.  In fact, it was the harbinger of a trend that would alter all of Faerûn.  Inexorably, the warming continued from one year to the next.  The water level of the Farsea Lake dropped until its edges were boggy and marshy, with an abundance of reeds.  Swarms of insects bred in the warm, stagnant water left behind.  The great desert Anauroch extended its boundaries southward.  The soil dried and cracked, and was swept up by the increasingly common sandstorms.  The topsoil vanished, and only rock and sandy silt remained on the exposed bones of the earth.

Decades passed.  Many in Faerûn prospered from the increasing warmth, immigrating to Narfell, Vaasa, and Damara, now ice-free.  But the goblins suffered.  Water rationing became a regular practice; famine visited the northern reaches of their realm.  The unrelenting sun blistered the yellow-orange skin of the goblins, which scaled off leaving weeping wounds.  Given goblins' natural hatred of sunlight, the pain caused by the sun's relentless assault was even more maddening.  The soil's loss of moisture even ruined long-inhabited tunnels and caves.  Thousands of goblins died, and thousands of others found themselves exposed to the elements- and fighting mad.

As the desert marched south, so did the goblins.  A few individuals straggled out first, but bands of refugees followed.  All came in search of respite from the blistering sun and choking sand.  They crowded into the villages, citadels, and castles seeking water, food, and work; they soon overwhelmed the capacities of all these.  Fights broke out over food and access to water; tunnels and lairs became cramped deathtraps too foul for even goblins to tolerate; idle hungry youths formed gangs to prey on those weaker still; and everyone grumbled about those in power- those who had no shortage of good food and clean water.  In this setting arose Izac Uthor.  This ambitious, second-rate commander was, above all else, a brutish, petty demagogue seeking self-aggrandizement and power.  Yet he tapped into the mood of the moment and catalyzed a war of conquest.

Izac Uthor had been a mid-level commander of combined goblin-orc forces before the exodus out of the devastated lands began in earnest.  In a bid to regain his depleted powers, he raised the spectre of war as a release to goblin suffering.  The disaffected refugees flocked to his banner.  Izac Uthor reveled in his new-found prestige, and recognized that the time for action had come.  After all, he saw, if you cannot care for your subjects- and he could not- you must send them to fight beyond the borders of the realm.  At best, you don't have to support them from your own resources, and you might win enough land and wealth to solve your problems.  At worst, you will have fewer discontented subjects.  In either case, many of the most capable and best-armed of them will have been eliminated by your enemies.  During the winter of 1089, Izac Uthor gathered the goblin armies near the abandoned village of Thandril, on the northwestern edge of the Goblin Marches.  The host included nigh unto 200,000 goblins, tens of thousands of affiliated orcs and kobolds, and a few thousand hobgoblins leading detachments of goblins or orcs. (The kobolds' tactics leave little need or use for sophisticated battleplans.)  Simple-minded and grinning, the host called themselves the Thugs of Uthor.  The goal of this offensive assemblage of viciousness was to capture the lands north and west of the great desert Anauroch.  "Overrun the North" was their guttural chant in goblin. (To ensure the proper enthusiasm in the expendable kobold shock troops, this was translated into kobold as "Overrun the Gnomes.")

Of course, even a force of more than a quarter million combatants could hardly hope to conquer, much less occupy, the entire Western Realms north of the Fields of the Dead.  Neither the Thugs of Uthor nor Uthor himself could grasp that they might have achieved a more limited and realistic military objective.  The host might have cut the Western Realms in two by taking the watersheds of the Marsh of Chelimber and of the Winding Water.  Controlling the roads and bridges, the goblins could have demanded toll and tribute from all people going through these lands.  But such an attainable strategic goal (although geographically complex) would not reduce to a monosyllabic battlecry.  It became the road not taken.  The brief rainy season of the year 1090 ended in the last days of Tarsakh.  The forces of imminent war, set in motion more than 50 years before, came to a head.  Compelled by a change in the weather, the motley, arm-swinging, knuckle-dragging horde marched north under the banner of the Thugs of Uthor.  First stop: Torgor's Triangle.  Torgor's Triangle was the name of a roughly triangular high plain formed by encircling granite upthrusts.

Of course, the gathering of the goblinoid hordes had not gone unnoticed in the settlements nearby.  The people had seen the desert expanding, and the concomitant shrinkage in goblin territories.  Many tense discussions were held in Cormyr, Hill's Edge, Tilverton, Soubar, Shadowdale, and other places in harm's way.  Some folk, due to their selfish shortsighted dispositions, noted the goblins' degrading conditions with glee.  Others talked of it in murmurs, fearing what it might portend.  It was the halfling community of Hill's Edge that first saw what was coming.  As the goblins prepared to march to Torgor's Triangle and beyond, the halflings sent out word to Tyrluk, Eveningstar, Cormyr, Arabel, Tilverton, and other villages to the south and east.  The local militia gathered to inhibit the horde's advance toward their homes.  Meanwhile, detachments of the regular standing armies were sent south and west along the fast trade road through Iriaebor to Hill's Edge.  Regular troops and the local militias were sent to Hill's Edge to join the main battle force uniting against the goblinoid horde.

They came from Beregost, Baldur's Gate, Berdusk, Iriaebor, Elturel, Scornubel, Soubar, and the reaches of the High Moor.  Although just five decades old and not as nearly as large as city as it is now, Waterdeep sent 20,000 humans to meet the evil foe.  The Dwarven Halls sent a fearsome army, battle axes gleaming as they marched without rest to join the assembling troops.  Though no one could remember having sent a messenger to ask, even a force of elves came to offer their services.  One squad hailed from Evereska, and a larger elven army came from Silverymoon and other forest homes in the north.  More than 140,000 people descended upon little Hill's Edge to join the combined army.  The prejudiced and the ignorant (and they are many) refer to the armies assembled at Hill's Edge as the 'forces of good' and the opposing goblin hordes as the 'forces of evil.'  This may even be factually true, in some sense.

No sooner had all the forces arrived than a leader was found: Artur Blevin, commander of the home forces of Soubar.  A choice of compromise, he ordered the combined forces north even as the Now I come to the true tragedy of the Battle of halfling militia of Hill's Edge dug in near their town, lest the goblins somehow escape to the south.

Artur Blevin's forces sought to flank the goblin hordes streaming out of the western border of the Goblin Marches.  The commander saw that, if his armies reached Torgor's Triangle first, they could deny goblins access to the natural fortress, and force them eastward into the desert.  There, the fierce sun and fearsome heat would take its toll among them.  Without resources, the goblinoid army would be destroyed.

It did not happen that way.

Scouting ahead, the elf contingent met Artur Blevin's van yet 20 miles from Torgor's Triangle.  They reported that the quick-moving Thugs of Uthor had already reached the southeastern rim of that high plain.  Blevin convened a hasty conference of the military leaders and strategists. They determined to wheel westward, to set up headquarters at the Hill of Lost Souls.  From there, they might steal into Torgor's Triangle from the north and west while Uthor's troops watched south for first sight of their foes.

Eventually the goblin outriders discerned the move, but by then the stage was set for the fateful confrontation.  Uthor's forces held the southern perimeter of the triangle; Blevin, the northwestern edge. A thin, weak flank of elves and humans held the northeastern side of the triangle against the enemy's escape. Between them all, a wide rocky plain stretched for 30 miles. Dwarves and goblins dug trenches and redoubts while the commanders awaited the decision that would start the fighting.

Two days and two nights passed in nervous quiet- no skirmishes, no patrols engaged.  Each side fretfully repositioned its men, bringing up reserves from the rear.  In doing so, they adding to the length of the battleline, and adding to the slaughter to come.

In their positions, warriors polished and sharpened their implements of destruction.  At the flickering fires of the human encampments, men wrote last words to loved ones or, more often, bade a cleric write the words for them.  They were men with time to kill, but no time left in which to learn to read or write.

The true tragedy of the Battle of Bones is not that the battleground became a gathering place of the undead. It is that the battle need never have occurred.

After two days, Uthor was well aware strength of Blevin's forces, and that they could be swiftly assembled whenever the goblins tried to break the out from their dwindling homelands.  Uthor knew there was little hope of defeating his opponents, little hope his armies might conquer a new homeland.  He also believed his men could retreat to the Goblin Marches, and the opposing armies would little impede withdrawal.

After two days, Artur Blevin was well aware of all of this, too.  He need only hold his position to thwart the enemy's expansionist plans.  He also knew that, should they retreat, he would not stop them.

Finally, each battle commander knew that the other had not attacked for two days and two nights.  They both knew the land around them was empty ground of little value to the assembled humans, dwarves, and elves- but of great potential value to the land-starved and over-crowded goblins.

If ever there was an objective opportunity for compromise and diplomacy- if ever there was a common ground for neutrality and sharing- this was it.  Yet at the third hour past midnight of the fifth of Mirtul, both commanders ordered their forces into a full fledged assault across an open plain to almost certain death. If one were to ask, they would say it was for honor, or to end for all time the power of the forces aligned against them.

Truth be told, they fought because they did not know how not to fight.  They could not tolerate the presence of those who believed differently.  Worse, they could not conceive of giving away their claim to something- the land- that by any rational assessment, was uncontested. They fought because their bigoted hatred of the enemy was expected.  The natural infravision of the Thugs of Uthor gave them the initial advantage in the night's clash.  The battle began with a short (and largely ineffective) long-range magical barrage.  This was swiftly followed by a screaming line of kobolds rushing across the plain to fall upon the opposition.  Despite the dark, the combined forces leapt up to counter the kobold assault with a wave of humanity. In the vastness of the battlefield- over 60 square miles- there was no orderly battleline.  All troops on both sides were ordered onto the plain before dawn; all fought wherever they found their foe.  No reserves were held back, and the sophisticated earthen defenses that had been thrown up were left behind in the armies' mutual eagerness to fight.  Wizards flung darkness and light, thunderbolts and ice, storms and silence across the fields of pain.  Hobgoblin artillery battered friend and foe alike until silenced by a fireball of prodigious proportions.

The first rays of dawn did not much help the men in Artur Blevin's forces.  In the night, almost a million feet had stirred the dust.  Swirling with the smoke of a thousand fires, a thick haze hung over the battlefield and no wind dispersed that cloud.

The bellows and cries of anger, fear, and pain echoed weirdly in the vast triangle of slaughter.  An eerie cacophony drowned out the leaders' orders, and no one could carry out planned maneuvers.  Each man fought for himself, with perhaps some fellow villagers beside him.  Goblin or human, dwarf or kobold, they were all unknowing how the tide of battle progressed, or if their individual survival had any meaning in the grand scheme of things.

After a time, the weariness and desperation of the battlers made it difficult even to identify the foe.  Every warrior standing was covered in blood and dust.  If it moved, you struck out.  If it ran, you impaled it.  If you dropped or broke your weapon, you picked up another from the dozens at your feet.  Everywhere lay the remains of those who failed the test of survival.

Legends say the battle lasted two days and two-and-a-half nights.  Some bards sing it as ten days and nights, but veterans swear no combatants could have fought even one full day without a break to eat, rest, and regroup.  Scattered as they were across the huge battlefield, perhaps exhausted opponents dropped where they stood, and were taken for dead until they rose to fight again.

A brief shower at dawn of the third day cleared the haze.  With visibility restored, the few survivors sought others of their kind and retreated to their first entrenched positions.  Among Artur Blevin's troops, none escaped unscathed.  If they could, survivors made their way to the Hill of Lost Souls.  Others, too wounded to move, lay trapped among the bodies of friend and foe alike, wailing for help.

Help never came.  Few had the strength to save any but themselves.  The bright fluttering standards atop the hill both beckoned and mocked them all, as the walking wounded struggled up the slippery, blood-slicked grass overlaying the volcanic bones of the hill.~

@650090 = ~History of Netheril's Shadowed Age~
@650091 = ~History of Netheril's Shadowed Age

The Shadowed Age of Netheril brought the first inklings of what was to befall the Netherese- it was a time when the shadows of doom crept around the Netherese landscape.  Beginning with Karsus's birth in 3163NY, this age heralded the arrival of the phaerimm, the birth of Olostin, and the discovery of even more powerful magic.  Its conclusion was marked by the utterance of a single spell; Karsus's avatar.

Many great arcanists were born in Netheril, and many of them outlived their own civilization by centuries, typically by lichdom.  While many of the most powerful Netherese were archwizards, it wasn't necessarily a requirement.  Of all those who did survive beyond the fall of Netheril, however, none were as great as Karsus.

Karsus's first spellcasting came at the tender age of two, when he instinctively cast a cantra.  Young Karsus found himself learning spells almost inherently, as though he always knew them.  The local priesthood of Mystryl took an immediate interest in the young man and trained him.  They tried to indoctrinate him into their church hierarchy, but he wasn't interested.  He didn't believe that putting his faith in a polytheistic structure would do him any good- he believed himself worthy of a god's stature.  This, of course, made him the perfect candidate for archwizardry, since all the archwizards believed in only themselves.  As Ioulaum perfected his greatest spell, Ioulaum's longevity, Karsus, at the age of 22, became the youngest archwizard ever.  To gain this title, one had to create a mythallar, carve an enclave from a mountain, erect a city upon it, and then claim it as his own.  For several months after his feat, Karsus was unable to procure businesses and residences, primarily due to his youthfulness.  He decided that if magical might alone couldn't attract citizens to his enclave, perhaps an image of success would.  Karsus hired some of the best architects in the land to create buildings that defied the very laws of gravity and physics.  These structures eventually became known as some of the greatest arcanist colleges and universities in Netheril.  The uniqueness of the structures, and the hope of having such a building for themselves, lured people to Karsus's enclave, and the city became successful.

In order to assure even greater success, Karsus persuaded the council of Seventon to loan his city the remaining nether scrolls in order to study them and see if there was a link between all the scrolls in order to find the ones that were missing.  Unfortunately, as the scrolls were en route to Karsus, the caravan (though guarded by over 100 warriors and arcanists) was ransacked and the scrolls were stolen.  An intense search for the thieves began in 3195NY but ended seven years later in failure, with the loss of 125 lives.  Netheril now had none of the nether scrolls in its possession, and their whereabouts perplexed even the greatest arcanists and seers.

A student in Karsus's academy for magical study, Shadow published a highly criticized work on the planes.  His work earned him the enmity of the establishment, and he was sent into exile.  All study of demiplanes and quasiplanes was banned in several cities.  In Karsus, though, Shadow was asked to stay and continue his studies; Karsus felt Shadow was onto something important.  Shadow invited other "underground" researchers to help him in his investigation, and Karsus financed the whole operation.  Eleven years later, with permission from Karsus himself, Shadow published another work, this time on the Demiplane of Shadow, entitled "Shadows: The Palpable Cohesion of Formless Corporeality."  Other archwizards throughout the nation suddenly realized the importance of this discovery and saw the Demiplane of Shadow as a perfect place for exploitation- a limitless supply of shadow servants and the source of Shadow's shadow-magic.  They immediately lifted the ban on demiplane research, openly encouraging all others to discover other demiplanes as well.   Unfortunately, they also discovered the Demiplane of Imprisonment, ultimately losing a handful of arcanists to its misty confines, though this loss was kept under strict secrecy.

Archwizards and researchers were not the only ones who left a lasting impression on history. Many individuals also forced their way into the annals of history.  One such individual was a human named Olostin.  Olostin was never given the opportunities that he felt he should be given, and he began to lash out angrily.  He hated others, but actually felt a certain amount of compassion toward the down-trodden nonhumans- those goblinoid races that Netheril and the elves had fought against since the beginning of time.  His hatred built up inside and he finally was ostracized by the Netherese, sent to wander the wilds of Netheril.  As he wandered, Olostin met up with a vicious beast that looked like a living cone with four arms- a phaerimm.  Olostin, frightful of his life, prepared to defend himself from certain death, but the beast simply wanted to talk.  The phaerimm claimed that some unknown force on the surface world was killing its children and making the old and infirm die before their time; it wanted to know who upon the surface was using magic.

Olostin sat and told the creature everything he knew of the Netherese culture and how they were wasteful and decadent.  The phaerimm listened to every word Olostin uttered about the Netherese.  After giving the renegade a powerful magical item and telling him where he could find a keep secure from the evil Netherese, the beast returned to its homeland. Olostin never saw his monstrous friend again but always felt that he was close at hand, helping him accomplish his deeds.

Those deeds were the very thing that preserved Olostin's name.  He and his band became the most ruthless murderers in the history of Netheril.  In the year 3348NY, he began a 33-year-long reign of terror with a successful attack on the city of Unity, where he was christened the Baron of Dread.  The Baron and his band killed more than 28,000-humans, elves, orcs, goblins, dwarves, halflings, and gnomes; it made no difference- and stole a king's ransom.  At the end of his career, he and all of his company were incinerated by a Noanar's fireball spell cast by an unknown arcanist in excess of 34th level.  The stronghold was gutted and everything inside was destroyed.  The magical item Olostin received from his conical companion, however, was never recovered.

-----------------------------------------
The Phaerimm:

After studying the information Olostin gave them and researching ways to sap the strength of the human nation, the phaerimm- one of whom was Olostin's "conical friend"- began casting their magic drain spells across the land in the year 3398NY.  The permanent magic drain spells began draining life energies as well, slowly killing everything within their sphere of effect.  They begin casting this powerful spell everywhere across Netheril's lands.  Fortunately for the Netherese, the effects of the magic drain spell were visible.  Near the largest flying cities, the land slowly began turning into a sandy desert.  At first, the archwizards were unconcerned; they simply flew the city to a different place.  As the "land's plague" continued to follow the cities, however, the archwizards knew something was wrong.  But in moving the cities around, they helped establish the borders of the desert that would one day be known as Anauroch.

As this plague progressed, the archwizards slowly discerned an intelligence working against them: the phaerimm.  From time to time, powerful archwizards would create new, more-powerful spells, only to be suddenly attacked by a wave of magic-hurling phaerimm intent on their destruction.  News of the phaerimm's open attack against the Netherese was slow to spread, however, for the phaerimm seldom left survivors, and their magic blocked most divination attempts to discover the truth behind this or that archwizard's disappearance.  The combined might of the magic drain and life drain spells caused quasimagical items to fail on the enclaves and tended to negate any other magical effect that wasn't permanently imbued into an item by use of a permanency spell.  Ioulaum's longevity spell was another that frequently failed, causing the creature's true age to rapidly catch up with it.  Spells could still be cast with norma1effects, however.

-----------------------------------------
Heavy Magic:

Karsus discovered that the phaerimm's magic drain was beginning to weaken the life-enduring magic he had constructed around himself, and he determined that he needed to find the source of the draining or choose a different way to stay alive.  He reverted to lichdom and began experimenting with heavy magic.  This graft of physics, chemistry, and magic was so unstable, Karsus felt that it would either be the end of Netheril- and possibly all of Toril- or a boost for the magic that seemed to be draining away.  His main reason for studying heavy magic was to destroy the denizens of the underworld who he believed were responsible for the ever-growing decline of available magic.

Heavy magic, unlike other forms of magic, was a tangible force.  It was like a sphere of clear honey that didn't leave any residue after contact but instead slowly extricated itself from any object it came in contact with.  Moving a hand or walking through heavy magic created effects similar to moving through hip-deep water.

Karsus discovered that heavy magic could be enchanted with other spells.  He also determined that heavy magic could be "painted" or "daubed" on any surface (like a wall, door, or mechanism), and the surface would take on the effect.  Karsus found it very handy to force a bit of heavy magic enhanced with a dispel magic into a lock, especially when it  disabled the use of detect traps and deactivated a magical lock pick set.  One cubic foot of heavy magic (weighing one pound) could be created by an arcanist for each level of experience, so when Karsus cast the heavy magic spell, he created 41 cubic feet. He enspelled the thick, gelatinous blob with a Volhm's drain spell, which was designed to transfer magical power to the largest power source within a 2,500-foot radius- and it began sapping the energies released from the mythallar.  The Volhm's drain spell both collected and sent the power back to the mythallar, robbing the enclave of magical power.  The whole enclave began toppling toward the ground, and the street lights and all the quasimagical items used on the flying city flickered and pulsed.  In a desperate move, Karsus levitated the heavy magic and used Tolodine's gust of wind to force it over the side of the city.  It plummeted to the High Forest.  Wulgreth, a renegade arcanist living in the area, was slain and turned into a lich when Karsus's heavy magic absorbed his life energies.  Karsus spent the next few years studying this new concept in magic and tried to make it work.  He liked the idea of enspelling a mass of heavy magic and liberally painting the spell effect on whatever he wanted.  He painted a Toscudlo's hallucinatory terrain on the walls and ceiling of an entire room, creating a sort of disoriented realm of dreams.  He was able to make a judicial podium that notified everyone in the courtroom when someone lied while on the stand.  While attempting to figure out other ways to use heavy magic, Unity, a city on the northern border of the Far Horns Forest, was infiltrated by fiends from the lower planes who sought the city as a staging grounds for an eventual takeover of Karsus.  They would have succeeded, but Karsus and his most trusted advisors and "friends" used heavy magic imbued with Oberon's dismissal and Aksa's disintegrate spells to banish and slay the beasts over a three-year time period.

Around the year 3505NY, the strange interaction of magic (due tothe phaerimm's' magic drain spells) began to worry the archwizards, and many of them left for points north and west.  One arcanist traveled west to create the human nation called Illusk, named after the culture that once lived there.  He used his magical power to build an entire city.  He died in the process, but his followers lived on the fruits of his labor.  Those that remained behind tried to discover a weakness they could exploit in the phaerimm, and they received some mysteri-ous assistance from a race of creatures known as the sharn.  The sharn cast magic that altered the very geography of the land when it came in contact with the phaerimm's magic drain and life drain spells, transforming mountains into rolling hills or increasing the spread of the desert.  The phaerimm were suddenly faced with a two-front war.~

@650092 = ~History of the Old Empires~
@650093 = ~History of the Old Empires

Toward the end of the previous age, tribes of humans were pushed out of the Great Kingdoms of the southeast, which were covered in desert.  Legends speak of a great war in which powerful humans fought against the gods to wrest away their power.  The humans won and became god-kings, but the war destroyed their kingdoms.  These god-kings, Re and Enlil, led the shattered remnants of their peoples into Mulhorand and Unther.  The two god-kings and their spouses became the leaders of the royal houses of these two nations.

The people of Unther, who prided themselves on the purity of their race, warred against barbarian peoples and drove them from their lands, but the god-kings of Mulhorand, who were openly worshiped by these people, took them in as full citizens.  Since then, the peoples of Mulhorand have primarily been racially mixed Turami and Mulan (the race of Unther and Mulhorand).

Two thousand years before the start of the current age, Mulhorand and Unther began to develop huge cities in the river deltas of their lands. Magic increased the fertility of the already rich soils and the two nations prospered.   Prosperity enabled the god-kings to build larger states and, over the course of centuries, large empires were established.  The two lands clashed occasionally, but the rulers of Unther and Mulhorand both realized that warfare would result in mutual destruction, so all conflicts were carefully limited and the border of the Alamber Sea kept the peace.  Mulhorand expanded to the north and east, conquering the Priador Plateau (which is modern Thay), Thesk, and beyond even into Ashanath and Rashemen.  Lands farther north paid tribute to Mulhorand and its god-kings.  At its peak, the Mulhorand Empire stretched as far east as Semphar.  While the empire was not the kindest of masters, it did bring laws, culture, and magic to thousands of people who had not known these things before.  Unther was somewhat less kind to its conquests.  It expanded north as far as Yuirwood, where it warred for centuries against the elven tribes.  It reached west as far as Chondath, swallowed most of the eastern Shaar, and even went to war against the southern dwarves in the Great Rift.  Unther gained a reputation for having fierce and ruthless warriors who were hated by those they conquered.  At their peak, 1,000 years before the start of the current age, the First Empires of Mulhorand and Unther were at a level that has never been equalled since.  Their magic was extremely powerful, and they had learned a new sciences and technology that gave them greater power.

Two events brought the first great Age to an end.  One was the rebellion of the archmage Thayd (after whom the later-day Red Wizards named their kingdom), who challenged the might of the god-kings, along with that of many of the most powerful wizards of Mulhorand and Unther.  Thayd's goal was to overthrow the god-kings and unite the empires into a single grand Overempire that would be able to achieve limitless dominion over the Realms.  After much destruction, the god-kings triumphed and the wizards were slain.  After that time, in Mulhorand, the god-kings placed magic under their strict control, and created a bureaucracy of priests to maintain its control.  Mulhorand became the bureaucratic theocracy that it remains to this day.  The people of Mulhorand and Unther might have rebuilt their losses, except for the Orcgate Wars.  Five years after the deaths of the wizards, a huge gateway opened in southwestern Thay.  It was a gateway from a world of orcs.  Millions of orcs had come from another world, seeking a new place to live.  They immediately clashed with the empires of Mulhorand and Unther, and overran their northern and western possessions.  The god-kings themselves stirred into battle, and orc-shamans summoned their pantheon in response.  Gods died, cities were laid waste, and entire regions were devastated.  In the end, the orcs were either slaughtered or driven into the far north, but the holds of Mulhorand and Unther on their far-flung provinces were broken, and the two empires dwindled.  The god-kings withdrew into their towers, creating continually reincarnating incarnations to lead their cities.  Thus the First Empires of Mulhorand and Unther ended.  The lands lost by the southern empires were quickly retaken, but not by them.  Instead, two new powers rose to prominence after the Orcgate Wars, the powers of Narfell and Raumathar.  These were warlike nations that coalesced out of the migrating northern tribes that were paid to fight as mercenaries in the Orcgate Wars.  They had weapons of iron (as opposed to the bronze weapons that Mulhorand and Unther used at the time) and soon developed powerful magic of their own.  They quickly subdued large tracts of land, replacing Mulhorandi culture with their own.

Unther was never able to regain its southern empire after the Orcgate Wars, and soon its holdings in Chondath collapsed.  So proud Mulhorand and Unther were now reduced to small kingdoms, once-great powers that were twilight kingdoms in the brilliant shadows of Narfell and Raumathar, the two new great powers.  And, for the most part, the two nations were content, for both still prospered; their rulers still built great monuments, and their peoples never starved, and wise men prophesied that the fiery powers of the north would soon consume each other.

The prophecy came true. Eventually, Narfell and Raumathar went to war. It was a bitter and bloody struggle, full of the tales of great heroes: Rauthok, Jesthren, Halduplac, and many others who were naught but names to the kingdoms of the south.  Several times, the two northern giants tried to convince Unther and Mulhorand to join in the war, but the lords of the south merely shook their heads and fortified their borders, waiting for the inevitable.

It came.  Narfell and Raumathar held one final cataclysmic battle and destroyed each other.  Netherworld fiends fought against dragons, cities were burned.  One hundred and fifty years before the founding of Cormyr, the nations of Narfell and Raumathar were dead, their people scattered into tiny enclaves, their lands in ruins.  Mulhorand and Unther decided to pick up the pieces.  Unther leaped across the Eastern Reach and founded cities on that body of water's northern coast.  Mulhorand expanded northward under the military leadership of Anhurtep, a vigorous incarnation of the god-king Anhur, and founded the cities of Bezantur, Tyraturas, Amruthar, Delhumide, and Nethjet.  Mulhorand offered to take in the survivors of the war and bring prosperity to the starving victims of the great war.  Mulhorand heroes slew many of the monsters summoned by the wizards of Narfell and Raumathar, and once again the standard of Mulhorand flew over the battlements of the Priador.  Thus began the Second Empire of Mulhorand and Unther.

Unther, which had declined greatly, could not reach the elves of Yuirwood with its traders or its armies.  The cost of expansion bankrupted its treasury, and taxes were raised.  Rebellions against the taxes were ruthlessly crushed, and harsh laws were brought down to preserve public order.  Some of the hardest hit by these taxes and laws were adventurers, who were beginning to bring wealth from the ruins in Narfell and Raumathar and complained most bitterly against the confiscation of most of the fortunes that they fought so hard to acquire.  Some of these adventurers turned to freebooting, becoming pirates in the Sea of Fallen Stars.  Others led rebellions in a number of cities hard hit by the tax: Delthuntle, Laothkund, and Mourktar.

Eventually a large group of cities on the southern coast of the Wizard's Reach also broke away to form what is known as the Union of Chessenta, Chessenta achieved brief glory early in its history under the great general Tchazzar, the war god, who was actually a polymorphed red dragon.  The Chessentan Empire held sway as far west as Chondath, and even subdued Unther and held it as its vassal.  After the death of Tchazzar, the Empire broke up; Unther tore free from its influence, and its distant outposts were ruined. The union's- though using the word 'union' to describe Chessenta is a joke- confederation of city-states swore fealty to a central monarch, but each city-state seemed to have a different idea about who the monarch actually was.  The union eventually deteriorated into a constantly changing network of warring factions; it remains this way to this day.  There have been two Cimbar vs. Airspur Wars, an Akanax vs. Soorenar War, an Akanax vs. Luthcheq War, and three Mordulkin vs. Luthcheq Wars.  There has been so much warfare in Chessenta that mercenaries from all over the Realms have flocked to join; there is almost always at least one major war going on there at all times.  For the last century, Chessenta has been reputedly one of the best places to go to get mercenaries; even Mulhorand regularly relies on their services.

And what of the other two lands?  Mulhorand kept its Second Empire together for a little longer, until the Red Wizards rebelled four hundred years ago and created the nation of Thay.  Mulhorand made a half-hearted attempt to take Thay back, failed, and decided to concentrate on its bitter internal politics.  Unther is even worse: Its military is gutted by corruption and archaic weapons and tactics, its immortal ruler (Gilgeam son of Enlil) has become embittered by misfortune and rules a small, wasted, overtaxed tyranny, aided by greedy administrators. As a result, Unther is on the brink of revolt.~

@650095 = ~A Treatise of the Phaerimm~
@650096 = ~A Treatise of the Phaerimm

These sinister beings are the present rulers of the Buried Realms, and the creators of Anauroch as we know it today.  Their mind-controlling spells hold even illithids in thrall, and influence-in a subtle but all-pervasive rule-all creatures beneath Anauroch.  Through controlled minds, the Phaerimm rule an entire nation of beholders who think themselves  independent, dwelling in several ruined cities of the Anaurian Underdark.  The beholders are mighty, employing Death Tyrants (undead beholders) and orc, hobgoblin, and xorn slaves of their own, as they mine for wealth and scheme to expand their realms southward and up to the surface world.  They are, however, loosely ruled by an Elder Orb, and that Orb, Rilathdool, is the pawn of the Phaerimm.  Phaerimm enjoy magic, and exult in wielding its unleashed power.  They are fascinated by new spells and effects, and admire those who show genius in the mastery and devising of magic: such as Phaerl, The First.

Phaerl perished in the War Against the Sharn, but Phaerimm still venerate his memory, and obey Phaerl's one-time colleague, Ooumraun 'The Seeker,' a ancient, huge, wrinkled Phaerimm who developed many of the Phaerimm spells (and, it is whispered, others of awesome power not yet revealed to fellow Phaerimm, with which Ooumraun has defended itself against the challenges and treacheries of ambitious Phaerimm over the years).  Although Phaerimm memorize spells much as human wizards do, they cast spells by effort of will alone, and can also adopt a single spell of each level as 'natural.;  The spell (which cannot be changed, once chosen) is retained in their brain structure. Phaerimm regain 'natural' spells without study every day.  Phaerimm are true masters of magic; some sages believe that their meddling may have created most of the magic-using monsters that menace the Realms today (including, perhaps, the beholder races!).  Even the least experienced and powerful Phaerimm are capable of developing strange and terrifying new magics, and the veterans of the race know or can anticipate every nuance and side-effect of magic they observe being wielded.  No elder Phaerimm will be caught unawares by a spell's range, precise effects, the results of its combination with other magics, or the like; but Phaerimm may be slow to unleash magic at intruders, for fear of playing into the plans of a rival Phaerimm.

So the Phaerimm rule-haughty, scheming always among themselves, but keeping behind a screen of mind-controlled slaves from mind flayers to giants, goblinkin of all sorts to humans. Ever they vie with each other for supremacy in non-violent, subtle confrontations of brinksmanship, one Phaerimm demonstrating the superiority of its strategy, forethought, and influence over that of another; and ever they seek to break the spell-bonds the Sharn have placed on them, and expand their influence over more and more of Faerun.  Where the Phaerimm cannot (yet) go, their agents can reach.

The Phaerimm are busily subverting the Red Wizards of Thay, any adventurers who come within reach (i.e., into Anauroch), and the Zhentarim who have intruded into Anauroch, too.  Even Elminster must tread warily around these titans of magic and intrigue; he can tell us little of the spells they have developed.  The moisture-drinking magics of the Phaerimm that created the wastes of Anauroch hold sway over the surface, but rarely stray into the depths beneath.~

The Aurilites seem to delight in causing death by freezing whenever possible, removing every shred of heat from their domains.  Priests of Talos simply revel in destruction for its own sake and their own personal pleasure.  Our brothers and sisters in the church of Umberlee cause havoc with the waves for the sole reason of terrifying travelers and fishermen into bowing before their childish god.

@650165 = ~Easthaven gained certain notoriety in the past many years after the terrible events that occurred there in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul, and it is the events that plagued the town that drew many historians, seers, and mages to the region seeking to know more of the Ten-Towns and the North.  This tome is not intended to be a comprehensive guide to the Ten-Towns nor detail the terrible events that occurred in the Year of the Cold Soul, its intention has been written merely to familiarize the reader with the people and day-to-day life in Easthaven. The town of Easthaven is one of the "Ten Towns" in the region known as Icewind Dale.

However, "town" may be a bit misleading for such a small frontier community as Easthaven - at least by southern standards.  Although it has experienced a surge of growth in the past few years, Easthaven is little more than a half-moon of modest dwellings clustered around the shores of the icy Lac Dinneshere.  The primary industry of Easthaven is the exportation of scrimshaw, a highly sought after craft material obtained from the bones of knucklehead trout, and visitors should not be surprised to find that the overall atmosphere of the town can be summed up as a snowy, frontier fishing village.  The buildings of the town are built primarily of timber, and the feel of the town reflects the hearts of the townspeople - nearly everything has a rugged feel to it, somewhat unrefined yet sturdy enough to withstand the harsh climate.  Scattered across the town is tremendous evidence of the town's fishing industry; nets, boats, fish racks litter the town in great abundance.Easthaven has been forced to rebuild over the past few years after the terrible events in the Year of the Cold Soul.  The Temple of Tempus has been rebuilt, although the relics that were stored within the basement of the temple have been moved south in accordance with the mandate of the high priests of Tempus.  Treasure-seekers or fortune hunters who come to Easthaven hoping to find some of the lost relics or arcane items believed to have left behind should be prepared for disappointment as the snows have been picked clean by visiting mages and thieves over the past twenty or thirty years.  Any scholars or explorers coming to the region should make sure to visit the town of Kuldahar to see the great oak in its splendor.  Despite many attempts to locate them, there have been no documented sightings of the aquatic elves rumored to live in the depths of Lac Dinneshere.  It is the author's opinion that the existence of these elves is merely one of the local myths intended to draw traders and settlers to the region.

@650166 = ~History of Kuldahar~
@650167 = ~The tiny valley of Kuldahar is nestled within the mountain range known as the Spine of the World, which is situated on the northern expanse of the continent of Faerun.  Its jagged, snow-capped peaks stretch from the Sword Coast in the west all the way east to the Anauroch Desert, separating the northern region known as Icewind Dale from the warmer and more "civilized" lands to the south.  Traditionally, access to Icewind Dale is limited to the caravan route that snakes from the frontier city of Luskan, around the western edge of the Spine of the World, and across the frozen tundra surrounding the Ten Towns of the Dale.  However, there exists another route, Kuldahar Pass, that is less traveled due to the inherent dangers of its geography.  The route through Kuldahar Pass consists of narrow and winding footpaths, barely wide enough to accommodate pack animals let alone caravan wagons.  The steep, snowy ledges of the pass provide enough of an obstacle to deter even the most enterprising of merchants.  Factor in the ever-present danger from giants and other denizens of the untamed mountain range, and it's a wonder anyone travels the route at all.  Those that do brave the route (and manage to survive) can find a small, secluded valley situated at the heart of the mountain pass.  In the center of the valley, in a cold and desolate place where plants and other foliage have no earthly business existing, juts a massive tree over three hundred feet tall.  The tree itself is a holy shrine of Silvanus, the Oak Father, the God of Nature and patron deity of Druids.  It was he who planted the seed and nurtured this giant oak thousands of years ago when Faerun was first born.  The shrine was intended to stand as a testament to the raw power of nature, a monument to its ability to thrive in the face of adversity.  For generations the devout followers of Silvanus have tended to the tree, and eventually the shrine became an oracle of sorts, a mystic site where druids throughout the realms could come and seek insight and revelations that would bring them closer to understanding the harmony between nature and man.  It was not until the past thirty to forty years that explorers first discovered the Pass and, subsequently, the little valley that housed this massive tree.  Tales soon began to spread about the unusual warm weather in this hidden valley, warmth that seemed to emanate from the tree itself.  It was only a matter of time before settlers began to arrive, seeking to build homes in a place that was obviously so close to the Gods.  At first, the druids sought to protect the holy site from the settlers.  The Archdruid in charge of the shrine at the time saw the settlers as an affront to the sanctity and seclusion of the site.  For years the druids kept the settlers at bay with barriers of thorny brambles and various druid tricks that kept the common folk in fear of the place.  Ultimately, their efforts were in vain.  Despite the druids' success at keeping the settlers away from the tree itself, they still would not leave the valley.  It wasn't until the succession of Archdruid Tolben, that the situation in Kuldahar Valley finally changed.  Tolben, unlike his predecessors, believed that the settlement of the valley was not only inevitable, but it was actually the will of Silvanus.  He believed that druids had been wrong in keeping the settlers away and that the Oak Father had intended people to share in the miracle of the Great Oak from the beginning.  When he finally became Archdruid, he formed a plan to fulfill the destiny of the sacred site by bringing about a union between the Great Oak and the settlers.  It was this union that the Archdruid Tolben believed would achieve the harmony the druids had been striving for generations: the harmony between man and nature.  As it stands, Kuldahar is a monument to this vision.  The tree and town exist in a natural symbiosis where it is next to impossible to tell where one leaves off and the other begins.As with the small fishing town of Easthaven, Kuldahar became the focus of the terrible war that raged in 1281 DR, the Year of the Cold Soul.  Great storms raged across the region, cutting off the Pass, and the circle of warmth around the great oak receded, forcing many of the inhabitants of Kuldahar Valley to abandon their homes and take refuge within the town.  Until Hrothgar's expedition from Easthaven finally arrived to rescue the town from the forces brewing in the Spine of the World Mountains, it seemed that the great oak would be destroyed and the town of Kuldahar would be buried in the great snows blanketing the region. Today, Hrothgar's body is said to lie buried in a glen within Kuldahar Pass.  The names of the heroes that traveled with him and saved Kuldahar have long since been lost, but their deeds live on, evidence of the persistence and strength of the people of the North.

@650168 = ~Heart of Winter~
@650169 = ~The Heart of Winter is often confused with the legendary Heartstone Gem, a powerful scrying artifact that serves as the heart of the great tree community of Kuldahar.  The Heart of Winter is not an object, but an expression frequently used by the Uthgart tribes of the north to refer to a warrior or creature that has rid itself of all except one driving focus - usually revenge or hatred.  The expression is often used to describe the barbarian lord, Wylfdene, who returned to lead the barbarian tribes in a campaign against the Ten-Towns in the Year of the Cold Soul (1281 Dale Reckoning).  According to legend, Wylfdene claimed to be the reincarnation of the shaman Jerrod, one of the barbarians' greatest heroes and the one who sacrificed himself in the final battle against the archmage Arakon many hundreds of years ago.  Claiming that his body had become home to Jerrod's spirit, Wylfdene rallied the tribes of the North to war to retake the lands that he claimed had been seized by the southerners of the Ten-Towns.  Establishing a great war camp in Bremen's Run, a narrow canyon under the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, he fought several quick battles against the dwarves and townsfolk of the region until a small band of adventurers arrived in the town of Lonelywood to try to carve out a peace between the Ten-Towns and the barbarians.  Their efforts at diplomacy are said to have failed, but they succeeded in defeating Wylfdene and saving the Ten-Towns from destruction.  It is believed that these adventurers are the only reason the Ten-Towns exist (and thrive) to this day. What happened to these brave adventurers is unknown.  The last known record of them is a sighting of them at the Whistling Gallows Inn in Lonelywood, where they spoke with a halfling traveler who claimed to know of a place where great riches could be found.  Shortly after this, the adventurers and the halfling vanished and were never heard from again.

@650170 = ~Legends of Icewind Dale~
@650171 = ~The greatest legends can stem from the humblest beginnings, and so it was with the band of adventurers that began their journey in the fishing community of Easthaven thirty years ago, 1281 Dale Reckoning.  Meeting in the Winter's Cradle Tavern, this band of southerners had traveled north in search of adventure, and they were the first to join Hrothgar's expedition to investigate the rumor of troubles brewing in the great tree town of Kuldahar to the East, where a mighty oak, towering hundreds of feet high, sheltered a small town beneath its boughs with a life-giving warmth.The misfortunes plaguing Icewind Dale led to the ambush of Hrothgar's expedition in the windswept Kuldahar Pass... and it left them the only survivors.  Pressing on against goblinoid raiders that filled the Pass, the small band finally reached Kuldahar, only to discover the great tree was being threatened by an unknown evil deep within the mountains - if this evil was not stopped, Kuldahar would be destroyed, and the North itself might soon share the town's fate. The brave band of adventurers searched out this evil, their travels carrying them from the crypts of the Vale of Shadows through the numerous ruins of the North, including the decaying elven fortress of the Severed Hand and the lava-filled caverns of Dragon's Eye.  Much of their journey has been lost, but there is no doubt that their efforts led to the salvation of Kuldahar and the Ten-Towns and their deeds are still spoken of in Easthaven and Kuldahar to this day.  Hrothgar himself has been laid to rest in a small glen near the town of Kuldahar, in memory of his selflessness in coming to the aid of his neighbor in a time when Easthaven itself was suffering troubles of its own. Among their other acts of heroism, the adventurers are credited with the discovery of the location of the tomb of Kresselack the Black Wolf, one of the most infamous of the Northern generals, the discovery of the Severed Hand, and numerous other monasteries and ruins believed lost to time and the snows of the North.

@650175 = ~The Ten-Towns:  Lonelywood~
@650176 = ~If it had not been for the rise of the barbarian king Wylfdene thirty years past and the terrible events surrounding his campaign against the Ten-Towns, Lonelywood would most likely have been forgotten by most of the North.  Straddling the rocky shores of Maer Dualdon and the alpine forest of Lonely Wood from which the town borrowed its name, Lonelywood has the dubious honor of being the northernmost settlement in all of Faerun.  The town lies in the shadow of Kelvin's Cairn, and the solitary mountain peak acts as a barrier that shelters both the town and forest against the harsh winds that blow down from the Reghed Glacier.  Although the town is protected from the wind, the weather is hardly temperate.  Snow still covers the ground nearly year around, and at night the temperature drops below freezing.Lonelywood is one of the youngest of the Ten-Towns.  It was only in recent years that it was recognized by the council as the tenth town.  Eighty years ago, there was nothing in the way of civilized settlements north of Termalaine and the area surrounding the Lonely Wood was rife with logger camps and lone trappers.  With the establishment of the Whistling Gallows Inn, however, Lonelywood gained a sense of permanency, and a small town slowly grew up around the Inn.Not surprisingly, commerce in Lonelywood revolves around lumber.  The Lonely Wood is the only respectable forest in all of Icewind Dale (hence the name, Lonely Wood), and all the lumber and byproduct in the Ten-Towns not imported from the south originates from Lonelywood.  Unfortunately, the vast majority of wood is imported from the south, which explains why Lonelywood remains such a coarse and isolated community.Its isolated position in the North makes Lonelywood vulnerable to attacks from the barbarian tribes that dwell in the icy plains surrounding the Ten-Towns.  It was the first of the towns in the path of the barbarian king Wylfdene and the united tribes of the Bear, the Elk, and the Great Whale in their campaign to drive the townsman from the North.  When Wylfdene was defeated by a band of adventurers from Kuldahar, the tribes scattered, and Lonelywood returned to its day-to-day routines not long afterwards. The Whistling Gallows still stands to this day, and the tree outside the Inn has become a post for travelers to carve their names into when they stay the night in Lonelywood.

@650177 = ~Severed Ties, Severed Hand~
@650178 = ~This book looks to be a recent work, compiled by a mage named Orrick.  The date listed on the cover of the book claims it was written in 1297 DR, fifteen years ago.  The script within is written in a tireless, steady hand, and it looks to be part of a larger volume of works.  The last page contains a passage worthy of note:"...when the elven fortress of the Severed Hand was shattered by Larrel's attempt to lay a Mythal, both the elven defenders and the armies of the horde that had invaded the halls of the fortress were reduced to shades, doomed to fight a never-ending battle within the great hand.  It is something of a intriguing thought to consider what would have happened had Larrel's attempt to lay the Mythal had succeeded, but such speculations can be linked to other speculations concerning the fall of the fortress, including the severed ties with the dwarves of Dorn's Deep, and the growing mistrust between the two races in the face of the threat the horde represented to the two kingdoms and of the North.  It cannot be forgotten that, if taken in perspective, even though it cost of the lives of his people, Larrel succeeded in his goals, for the Mythal served to break the back of the Horde's thrust into the Spine of the World.It is the theory and practice of the Mythal that intrigues me and many other scholars to this day.  Was it arrogance that led Larrel to believe he could cast such a powerful enchantment believed to be possible only with several archmages working in unison, or was it *truly* possible, and it was only the presence of the Horde within the halls of the Severed Hand that led the enchantment astray? When I first came to the North it was to seek out the Severed Hand and find the remnants of Larrel's work, but it wasn't until a band of glory seekers from Easthaven traveling the region found the ruined elven fortress for me and retrieved a tome from its library that I was truly able to embark upon my research.  After confirming that the adventurers had made it safe to walk the halls of the fortress again, I abandoned my tower in Kuldahar to the elements, set Weenog on his way (with instructions to return to his tribe and cause no mischief), and traveled northwards to the fortress." The last paragraph in the book has been marked in red ink, but there is no note indicating why it was highlighted.

@650179 = ~Traveler's Guide to Icewind Dale~
@650180 = ~The region of Icewind Dale is commonly considered to be the land that lies north of the Spine of the World that has not (yet) been covered by the Reghed Glacier.  The name Icewind Dale stems from the great storms that lash the region, storms that strike with such strength and viciousness that they can level buildings and carry away anything not tied down.  The weather aside, the region is made more inhospitable by the yetis that roam the tundra, along with the great frost giants, polar worms, and winter wolves that inhabit the region in great numbers.  It is frequently said that no sane man travels to Icewind Dale, for it is not the place for civilized folk.  During the past many years, however, it has been a lodestone for explorers, greedy rogues, and hardy souls that seek to start a new life far from the southern kingdoms of Faerun, and it has attracted some of the greatest adventurers known in the history of the Realms.  To say that it also attracts its share of men on the run from the "restrictive" laws of the south would not be inaccurate, and in recent years, in light of the troubles that occurred in the Ten-Towns of Easthaven and Lonelywood, it has also drawn its share of fortune-seekers, treasure hunters, sages, and historians, all of whom are seeking to exploit the history and past conflicts of the region for their own interests.  Many of them do not survive to return home, and ill-prepared curiosity seekers should steer clear of Icewind Dale.The signposts of civilization in Icewind Dale can be found in a collection of frontier settlements called the Ten-Towns, which are clustered around the three lakes in the region: Maer Dualdon, Lac Dinneshere, and Redwaters.  The waters of these lakes are home to a rare species of fish known as the knucklehead trout, which thrive in the icy waters of the lakes and provide the Towns with their main industry: fishing.  The knucklehead trout are known for their great fist-sized heads, and their bones are of such a white hue (and rare enough) to command a price to rival that of the ivory from the jungles of Chult.  Scrimshanders, artisans who carve the heads of the knucklehead trout into sculptures and works of art, are highly respected in Icewind Dale, and there is a great demand for their works as far south as Baldur's Gate. If the Ten-Towns has a heart, it is the walled town of Bryn Shander (one of the only two towns of the Ten that are walled, the other being Targos), and this town is the destination of most travelers in Icewind Dale - or at least those who have no interest in the fishing trade.  A narrow trail called the Eastway leads from Bryn Shander to the shores of Lac Dinneshere, where one can find the towns of Caer-Dineval and Caer-Konig on its western flank, and the fishing community of Easthaven to the south.  Of these, Easthaven has gained the most notoriety over the past years, most likely due to its role in the conflict that struck the region in the Year of the Cold Soul, 1281 DR and sealed off the town from its brothers.The smallest of the three lakes in the region, Redwaters, is the lake that lies to the south of Lac Dinneshere.  It takes its name from the battle waged on the tundra where the towns of Good Mead and Dougan's Hold now stand.  To the west and north is Maer Dualdon, the largest of the three lakes in the region, and the home of the remaining four towns of Icewind Dale that cluster about its shores: Termalaine, Targos, Bremen, and Lonelywood.  The town of Termalaine is widely regarded as the most beautiful of the settlements, with trees planted within the town and walls built around the homes to shield them from the wind.  The town of Bremen lies at the outflow of the river that drains Maer Dualdon into the Shaengarne River and not surprisingly, its position results in a steady stream of barbarians, river traders, and merchants.  South of Bremen lies the walled cliff town of Targos, known for its impressive port (for the region), and the standing Targos Guard, one of the largest forces in Icewind Dale.  The last and northernmost of the Ten-Towns, the logging community of Lonelywood, is known primarily for its logging industry.  Like Easthaven, Lonelywood has also experienced its share of troubles in the past thirty years, and it was feared that the town would be lost when the barbarians began their campaign against the Ten-Towns under the leadership of the barbarian lord Wylfdene in the Year of the Cold Soul.  Despite this threat to the region, Lonelywood survived, and even prospered, growing to export lumber throughout the region. Last among the signposts of the region, the great peak of Kelvin's Cairn can be found squatting midway between Lac Dinneshere and Maer Dualdon.  According to Uthgart legends, Kelvin's Cairn takes its name from the fallen frost giant Kelvin Duarol, who was slain by the god Tempus.  As a warning, Tempus is said to have pulled huge rocks from the plain and piled them atop his foe, both to mark his victory and to warn others of what will befall them should they attempt to cross the God of War.  This is one of the many holy sites of Tempus that lie within Icewind Dale, and it is the reason that many priests and temples of Tempus can be found throughout the North.

@650181 = ~High Priestess Lysara's Journal~
@650182 = ~This journal, bound in exotic, jewel-encrusted leather and written with fine ink on parchment made from spider silk, reads as follows:  Where to begin...?  It hath been a tough life, to be sure - even from birth.  Being part of conjoined triplets, separated at the brink of death, has its boons and banes - as does any aspect of life I suppose.  I can hear my sisters' thoughts and feel their pain, but never have I known what it means to be alone - truly alone...  Luskan was a gruff town - unforgiving, even if viewed in its best light.  'Tis certainly no place for three innocent, little women, but the bond we shared kept us together and alive.  Our parents were never around - always chasing the latest job offer or most-favorable rumor just to make ends meet.  With ruffians, bandits, and creatures of the night lurking in every shadowy corner, there were no individuals we could respect... except one - Lysan...  Lysan, a priestess of Auril and fellow Luskanite, shone like a celestial beacon across a sea of eternal darkness, and became our idol and inspiration with little effort.  Her goodwill and fortitude we adored - her adventurousness we admired.  What greatness the four of us would hath achieved - how noble our exploits would hath been in spreading our seeds of compassion throughout the winter land, only to watch them blossom into flowers of love come spring!  The goal was as clear as a crystal trapped within a drop of ice, until...  Where was I when the news pierced our hearts like a javelin hurled from the Nine Hells Itself...?  Lysan... poor, sweet Lysan was slaughtered, like a diseased goblin, in Kresselack's Tomb by a band of villains in heroes' clothing.  Why?!  Because of her beliefs?!  Thirty years hath passed, yet the pain lingers.  At that moment a new goal emerged - her path was now ours, and we immediately joined the church of Auril in town...  Our ambition quickly dwarfed that small temple, so we headed east to join Auril's Breath in Glister.  Ironically that congregation proved too large for us, so we headed north to establish a church of our own, as well as retrace the steps of our martyr, Lysan.  Reinforcing our decision to travel north, we had also heard that the mysterious demon twins we knew of in Luskan were also in that area, so we undoubtedly had to see if those rumors were true...  En route we stumbled upon an envoy from the Legion of the Chimera and were eventually led to Madae.  Despite our humanity, the four of us became instant, though reserved, friends, and 'twas soon obvious that her wants, needs, and desires complimented our own...  The deal was simple - if we guarded the Western Pass against reinforcements to the Ten-Towns, they would destroy Kuldahar and give us its precious Heartstone Gem.  The pieces of our plan were falling into place - all we needed was the right time to seal them together...  That time came during our Coming Storm festival when my sisters and I led our newly formed congregation of one hundred strong in a prayer so profound, Auril Herself blessed us with Her embrace.  The glacier was thus born.  All that remained was the temple's creation - *our* temple - which Nickademus, arch-architect, honored guest and former lover of Oria accomplished with impressive speed and skill...  What an oddity - this temple of his.  Even *I* get lost from time to time.  The dais is an interesting concept, but why must I turn it left north, then right all the way around again just to unleash the abishai to do my bidding?  Still, no effort is too great in pleasing Great Auril by sacrificing prisoners to her to keep the glacier from melting...  Time is short, so the painting - though it seems to possess a mind of its own - is useful when I must quickly cleanse myself before speaking to the Frostmaiden...  The prism is a dangerous device, but what Lady Sherincal wants she gets - still, it keeps prying eyes away from Mother Winter and our treasury, so perchance I judge it too harshly...  Oria's Game Room is a waste of time to me - I hath no time for meaningless combat and see no reason to enter the ethereal realm while confined to its limited boundary.  And *why* Nickademus would install a Mirror of Life Trapping eludes all logic and common sense...!  Nickademus... I wish I could trust him - he does not walk our path.  For his sake, I hope he does not betray us again...

@650185 = ~Valas - The Black Raven~
@650186 = ~This tome details the history of Valas Belaem Del Pharm, the Black Raven, and that of the Black Raven Monastery.  The monastery was built in the year 1181, founded by a half-human, half-drow slave who escaped his cruel masters in the underdark, fighting his way to the surface world and freedom with nothing more than his bare hands and the very chains that once bound them.  The half-drow's name was Valas Belaem Del Pharm - Valas, Slave of Pharm.  As a child Valas was a house-servant of the Leun, but soon grew into a lean and powerful young adult.  While most families are reluctant to keep such dangerous slaves, Valas was lost in a wager to an opposing family - the Pharm - who kept him alive simply to spite the Leun.  Valas became the greatest champion of the Pharm's gladiator stable - in fact, the greatest of all of the Rilauven stables - before he escaped.  It was then, during the decades spent in the dark city's majestically spired arena of blood sports, that Valas developed his legendary fighting skills.  The book goes on to recount in detail how Valas escapes, surfacing in the Spine of the World at the headwaters of the Black Raven River.  The first men he comes across are the Uthgardt barbarians of the Black Raven Tribe at Raven Rock.  The barbarians don't know what to make of Valas, who shows up out of nowhere with crimson eyes, jet-black skin and hair to match, half-naked and with bloody chains dangling from his wrists.  Naturally, their bravest attack... and are promptly defeated.  The barbarians think him a spirit warrior sent to punish their arrogance and christen him the Black Raven, a name that Valas takes as his own.  They're later saddened but slightly relieved to see him leave.  Valas travels the world as the Black Raven, fights against slavery and imprisonment wherever it's found (making a great deal of enemies in the process), collects a throng of loyal students, teaches them his ideals and martial techniques, and eventually returns with them to the Spine of the World to build the Black Raven Monastery.  He eventually dies quietly of old age, is interred beneath the monastery in a tomb near the underground headwaters of the Black Raven River, and with that his story ends.

@650194 = ~Mensel of Cormyr, at one time the Lord of Immersea, was that rare sort of nobleman, a fellow well known to be kind, generous, and humanitarian to a fault.  He was much loved by his family, servants, and those that lived upon his lands.  Well after the elderly Lord Mensel had passed away in his sleep, a secret vault was found hidden beneath his study.  Within the vault Mensel's heirs found a small hoard of treasure... and the Obscene Grimoire.  Though the origins of the grimoire and the identity of anyone associated with it - save the late Lord Mensel, of course - are still unknown, unwholesome rumors sprang up like mushrooms and still abound after nearly a century.  The worst of the scandalous claims involved a seer from Arabel, a pious young man that seemed saddened to explain that Lord Mensel had the grimoire fashioned for himself at great expense and then slew all those involved in its making - an assertion that did no less than bring ruin to Mensel's name and family.  The unsavory book was cast into a temple brazier but, to the astonishment of numerous witnesses, it vanished in a cloud of foul-smelling vapor rather than bursting into flames.  Since that day the Obscene Grimoire has appeared in many places, never found intentionally and always disappearing again within a few year's time.  The thick, black, leather-bound book is filled with painstakingly detailed woodblock prints, each depicting a gruesome scene of violent perversion.  Even the briefest of glances through its disturbing pages is enough to assure the reader that no taboo is left unturned.  However, for those willing to carefully peruse the disquieting work, there are dark runes and ritual directions hidden amongst the illumination around each print.  Those so inclined are able to use the power of Mensel's Obscene Grimoire to summon a cacofiend, bound to the reader's service, one time before the book vanishes.  

STATISTICS:  

Special:   Using the grimoire casts both Protection From Evil and Cacofiend.   The Obscene Grimoire vanishes after a single use or when one attempts to destroy it.

@650196 = ~The Tome of the Supplicant is a heavy volume whose intricately illuminated vellum pages contain numerous short prayers woven with words of power and calling.  One may read aloud from the tome once per day, bestowing favor by calling upon his god to grant him power for a short period.  When he does this, his strength, constitution and dexterity all are raised by 1 point.

@650198 = ~The Tome of Sacred Verse is a collection of hymns and lyrical prayers woven with words of power and calling, penned in the blood of a willing planar.  Twice per day a reader may sing a passage aloud, the book's power making his or her voice as fine and clear as radiant crystal.

@650199 = ~A Treatise upon Flesh Golems~
@650200 = ~This large, hand-written tome details the efforts of the wizard Imphraili - a specialist in the school of transmutation - to enhance what she refers to as the "languid, wholly inefficient flesh golems of our day."  Most of the book is filled with various alchemical formulae, surgical procedures, chemical treatments and the like to be given to the inanimate golem before it is awakened.  In the final chapter, however, she details the creation of the Sanguis Anima, a fluid necessary in the animation of such an enhanced golem.  Once the fluid is injected into the creature and the golem is blasted with electricity, it will awaken to serve its new masters.  There is a warning, however - the modified golem will not be able to stand the touch of direct sunlight.  Using this tome and with the proper chemicals - the author mentions a variety of giant fungi spores in addition to other more typical reagents - and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled wizard or alchemist could probably concoct the Sanguis Anima.

@650201 = ~Imphraili's Transfusion Notes~
@650202 = ~These are the notes of the wizard Imphraili, a specialist in the school of transmutation.  Their contents revolve largely around the theoretical application of the Sanguis Anima - an alchemical fluid she uses in the process of animating a flesh golem - as a means of physically invigorating or extending the lifespan of a living creature.  Imphraili clearly states that the procedure would be insanely dangerous and that only a dedicated practitioner of the art of transmutation could carry it out; it requires the imbiber to magically alter the state of the Sanguis Anima - normally deadly poison to any mortal humanoid - as it courses through his or her blood.  Using these notes and with the proper chemicals - the Sanguis Anima in particular - and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled transmuter with a taste for danger could probably perform the procedure.

@650203 = ~Progress Journal: Viciscamera~
@650204 = ~This is the progress journal for a project called "Viciscamera."  Scribbled in painstakingly small, cryptic shorthand, it is for the most part entirely illegible.  The most recent entries seem to revolve around the project's success, boasting that the Viciscamera is entirely functional and now requires only the slightest of biomagical alterations to perfect.  The writer seems particular proud of the Viciscamera project's natural and magical defenses... with its tough, ensorcelled hide and exhalation sacs of airborne corrosive gas, the thing seems nigh indestructible.  Hastily scratched notes in a sidebar mention a possible weakness, however: one could possibly create an enchanted poison that would turn the Viciscamera's defenses upon itself, essentially forcing it to self-destruct.  In addition to the required range of somewhat typical alchemical reagents, the author mentions a variety of giant fungi spores and "a curious, silvery fluid similar in consistency to mercury."  Using these notes and with the proper chemicals and access to an alchemical laboratory, a skilled wizard, alchemist, or maker of poisons could probably concoct a magical, specially-tailored conversion poison capable of destroying the Viciscamera project.

@650205 = ~Malavon's Journal~
@650206 = ~Malavon's journal is largely illegible, the greater portion of it being written in a mix of ancient elven and a complex code he devised and perfected over a century and a half ago.  One of the more recent decipherable entries, however, is of some interest: Malavon wrote of the Z'hinda citadel, a drow stronghold that fell into the hands of the illithid - mind flayers.  The citadel's gates are magically sealed, nigh impossible to open from without.  The drow had intended to assault the citadel's guards, prompting them to open the gates to summon more thralls and thus expose the citadel interior.  However, with the arrival of so many driders in the area, the gate guards withdrew into the citadel and have yet to return.  Malavon is certain that if the number of driders can be reduced, the citadel guards will return to their position at Z'hinda's gates.  To this end, he planned to find and destroy whatever it is that is responsible for the driders' sudden increase in numbers.

@650209 = ~The Last Alliance I: The Elves~
@650210 = ~Several hundred years ago, it was decided the elves would establish themselves in the North.  They sought to expand their sphere of influence and they also saw it as an opportunity to place a watchful eye on anything occurring in the frost-covered lands to the North.  The archmage Larrel was placed in charge of this task.  With a strong army at his back and the resources of the surrounding elven kingdoms, Larrel set forth to the Spine of the World Mountains.  Many years were spent making a route to the Northlands and finding a suitable location, and he eventually established an elven fortification in a forest that the elves felt comfortable calling home.  Under his guidance, the outpost thrived and became the elven eye that they dreamt of creating.  It was at this time that the dark horde made their presence known.  A force mostly composed of goblins but within their ranks, some orc and ogre tribes, made their way to the North in search of new lands to rape and pillage.  Inevitably, conflict broke out between both sides as they fought for control of the surrounding lands.  For months, constant battles erupted taking their toll on both sides but neither ever gaining a foothold.  As more time passed, the elves eventually found themselves waning.  Although the elven forces were superior in battle against the ill equipped and untrained horde, they found themselves hard pressed to keep their ranks filled and well supplied due to the long distance between themselves and the elven kingdoms to the south.  The elves of the North were in serious trouble and the horde knew it.    In what seemed to be a small period of silence to the elves, the persistent attacks of the evil races stopped.  What they didn't know was that they retreated back only to amass themselves into an enormous attack force.  Once assembled, they began their march back towards the elves with the intent of driving them from the Spine of the World Mountains once and for all.

@650211 = ~The Last Alliance II: The Dwarves~
@650212 = ~Not long after Larrel had created his elven fortress in this area, a clan of dwarves had been working on settling a portion of the land as well.  These dwarves came with the hopes of creating another dwarven citadel in the Spine of the World Mountains.   Unfortunately, all initial attempts by these dwarves were met with destruction at the horde's hand.    This wasn't the first time that dwarves had to deal with resistance from these dark races.  History has shown that the dwarves are very experienced in dealing with this threat.  As their ancestors before them, these dwarves would deal with them in the same manner by utter eradication.  The dwarves gathered their numbers and pushed into the Spine of the World Mountains to rid the area of this threat.  Initial scouts found that the darker races had amassed into an enormous attack force heading west.  The dwarves were smart enough to know that mindlessly attacking the horde would only result in high casualties if not defeat.  They followed the horde from a far and cautiously waited for the right moment to strike.

@650213 = ~The Last Alliance III: The Darkest Hour~
@650214 = ~The elves found themselves under attack again immediately as the horde entered the forest.  The outpost, although designed as a very defendable fortification, began to break under the force of its reckless attackers.  Although the horde was taking heavy casualties, they were winning.  Piece by piece, they were taking apart the elves.  Their outer defenses were eventually breached, and soon after, the main line of defense crumbled.  When all seemed lost to the elves, a battle cry was heard in the distance.      The dwarven force watched in the distance as the horde began to lay waste to this remote outpost.  As they watched, they knew the orcs were completely frenzied with their blood lusted attack to notice what lay waiting behind them.  The dwarves knew this was the time to strike.  With a battle cry that rang throughout the battlefield, the dwarves charged into battle.  The horde was completely caught off guard and the dwarves took full advantage of it.  The dwarves cut down the rear guard with ease and pressed the attack.  The horde's vanguard immediately ceased their attack on the elves to deal with the dwarven threat.    Given their only chance of living through this battle, the elves marshaled their remaining forces and with renewed strength, began a counter attack.  With the battle turned, the horde was in no way prepared to fight against two fronts.  Every last member of the horde was viciously cut down and thus ended their presence in the Spine of the World Mountains.

@650215 = ~The Last Alliance IV: The Dwarf Alliance~
@650216 = ~Much to the elves surprise, they never expected to be saved by a bunch of "rock eaters."  As for the dwarves, they never expected to charge into battle to rescue a bunch of "arrogant high elves".  Regardless, victory from a battle of this magnitude was reason enough to see past these petty racial differences.  From this day, a great alliance was formed and together, they formed homes for their people.  For the dwarves, the citadel known as Dorn's Deep was created.  For the elves, the tall fortress known as The Hand of the Seldarine was built.    200 years passed and the alliance thrived.  During this time, the human settlements also began to grow at an alarming rate, due to their short life spans.  It was also during this time that the darker races began reappearing in the north.  Remnants of the original invading tribes grew to a point where they needed to expand into new territories.

Weight:  1 lb.~

@650217 = ~The Last Alliance V: Echoes of the Fall~
@650218 = ~Soon after, a long and fierce debate placed pressure on the alliance.  The dwarves saw a huge potential for wealth by selling some of their great artifacts to the human settlements.  The elves were vehemently opposed to this as they felt the humans were not worthy of such valued creations.  Although they had embraced their neighboring dwarves as comrades, the elves were still isolationists at heart.  In the end, the dwarves grudgingly conceded to the elves on this matter.  Small skirmishes started again between the alliance and the darker races.  Still ill equipped and untrained as before, the alliance spent little time being concerned.  Their complacency derived from the alliance being well established in the region along with the devastating power of their artifacts.  Little did they know that the dark races were entrenching themselves within the recesses of the Spine of the World Mountains.  With new armaments in hand, the large reckless horde of the darker races soon became a deadly force to contend with.  Attacks on the alliance became fiercer and more violent.  Although the alliance still found themselves on the winning side of each battle, they began to take unacceptable losses.  Also more disturbing was the discovery that the horde had within their possession the very same weapons that both races created together.    Both races of the alliance spent months trying to find a logical explanation to the horde's possession of their magical artifacts.  During this time, the attacks from the dark races became more frequent and fiercer, straining the old ties of the alliance.  Soon, this turned into distrust.  The elves began to insinuate that the dwarves broke their promise and sold weapons to the untrustworthy humans who then sold them for a larger profit to the horde.  The dwarves resented such accusations considering they had just as much to lose from the darker hordes gaining these weapons.  This distrust became uglier as old discriminations of the other race began to surface.

@650219 = ~The Last Alliance VI: The Fall~
@650220 = ~The Fall of the Hand of Seldarine

The old ties were broken.  Soon, it all turned into hatred based on racial mistrust.  It was the easiest way either side could explain why the dark horde grew in power with their very own weaponry.  Any hope of working it out in a civil manner was gone.  With the alliance destroyed, conflict was inevitable.  Battle broke between the two races and the darker races spared no time taking full advantage.  The elves were now alone.  The horde continued its attacks and without the aid of the dwarves, the elves found themselves hard pressed.  The other main difficulty was that most of the elven kingdoms to the south were either abandoned or lay in complete ruin.  Reinforcements from their own kind were far and few in between.  It became apparent that the elves were losing and would eventually be overrun.  Larrel sent word to Evermeet, and many of the far away elven kingdoms, that support was needed to keep them alive.  Unfortunately, any reinforcements sent would be months away at best.  The elves had to buy time or face annihilation.  Larrel, left with no choice, began the chain of events that destroyed the Severed Hand and led to the final fall of the elves.  When the dark races breached the final defenses of the Hand, he attempted to cast a mythal in the hope of preserving all that he held dear...   A hand written entry has been appended to this page.  It states:  It is rumored that a dark elf by the name of 'Nym' was the individual truly responsible for the fall of the Hand.  Through magical means he entered the vaults of the dwarves, stole their artifacts, and sold them to the goblinoid armies.  He then sat back and watched as the elves and dwarves destroyed their alliance with accusations of guilt.  It is speculated that Nym did this to remove a significant threat to the drow population in the area of the Hand.  With the elves and dwarves vanquished, the drow were free to claim the territory as their own with no consequence...

But not until he's gone Demi, Remi,
Or he won't talk to thee.

Who's survived without a challenge since centureis ago?
Are they expensive and where do you have to go...
... To get rid of Kangaxx?

Some tools are pricey; perhaps you have no cash to spare
And you can't shoplift from Ribald as the Amnish Guard is there.
With all your abilities it doesn't seem unfair
To have a cheaper way of killing Kangaxx...
...Cheaper way of killing Kangaxx.

Wield the Improved Disrupting Mace, Grace,
Or the Sling of Everard, Gerrard,
You could use the Staff of Rynn, Lynn,
Better than +3.

Knock him down with Crom Faeyr, Blair,

Could try the Withereing Spear, Lear,

@650233 = ~Conchobhair:  A Biography~
@650234 = ~Excerpt:

Conchobhair originally hails from Waterdeep.  He is the younges of four sons of the very influential Strongblade family in Waterdeep.  However, being the youngest he had little hope of inheriting much of the family's holdings, so he set out to make a life for himself when he reached the age of twenty.  He started his training as a paladin and spent a few years lifing the virtous life of the paladin.  However, he eventually felt too restricted with the discipline and wished for something with more glory.  On one of his treks from Waterdeep to Baldur's Gate, he met a warrior by the name of Fergus Ravenskill.

Fergus was a very valiant warrior and had spent most of his fifty-six years on the battle field.  Conchobhair had spent a few months on the road with Ravenskill and his tales of greate battles intrigued him.  However, it was not until Fergus told him of his encounter with a blue dragon that Conchobhair decided to make a life change.  He asked Fergus to train and teach him everything that the older warrior knew.  He spent six years training with Fergus in the ways of a seasoned warrior and even took positions as mercenaries for a few of the larger cities in the area.

One fateful day brought Fergus and Conchobhair face to face with a Red Dragon.  This was a dragon that Fergus had encountered some twenty years prior, in which Fergus had injured it by blinding it in one eye.  The dragon was bent on seeking his revenge and the opportunity presented itself.  Fergus died in the attack, suffering multiple burns from the blazing breath weapon and Conchobhair escaped with minor burns and wounds.  It was on this day that he vowed to destroy any dragon that presented a threat to the Realms and to find the dragon that killed his friend and mentor.

@650236 = ~Excerpt:

Being of noble birth Jet'Laya's "uncle" Lennan went out into the world seeking adventure.  Upon his journey he meet and had his life saved a few times by Jet'Laya's furture father, Torvin.  After traveling together for some time and becoming close friends, her father and "uncle" returned to Cormanthor.  Once in the city, Lennan introduced Torvin to his father, a wealthy and powerful noble.  Being quite impressed with Torvin and being thankful for his actions of courage- saving Lennan's life- he fought to get Torvin accepted into the city.  He was successful, and Torvin quickly became liked by most; eventually falling in love with Jet'Laya's mother, who was one of Cormanthor's healers.  Their marriage was looked down upon by several members in the society, forcing them to live near the edge of the forest.

When Jet'Laya and her twin brother were six, Cormanthor was attacked by a group of undead, led by a young brash Vampire.  She and her brother were hidden in safety, while the elves defended the city.  The entire group of attackers were killed, however the elves also incurred several casualties, including Jet'Laya's parents.  Her older sister was never found and presumed dead as well.  Seeing her parents killed was a constant source of nightmares for Jet'Laya, and she vowed revenge for her parents death upon all undead.  Despite the best efforts of her Uncle Lennan and her twin brother, who seemed less affected by his parents deaths, she could not be swayed from her path and left as soon as her training, as she called it, was complete.

@650237 = ~Elminster's Ecologies~
@650238 = ~Excerpt:

The Year of the Spreading Spring was regarded merely as a year with a short rainy season and an unpleasantly warm summer.  In fact, it was the harbringer of a trend that would alter all of Faerûn.

The water level of the Farsea Lake dropped until its edges were boggy and marshy, with an abundance of reeds.  Swarms of insects bred in the warm, stagnant water left behind.  The great desert Anauroch extended its boundaries southward.

As the desert marched south, so did the goblins.  A few individuals straggled out first, but bands of refugees followed.

During the winter of 1089, Izac Uthor gathered the goblin armies near the abandonded village of Thandril, on the northwestern edge of the Goblin Marches.  The host included nigh unto 200,000 goblins, tens of thousands of affiliated orcs and kobolds, and a few thousand hobgoblins leading detachments of goblins or orcs.

Of course, even a force of more than a quarter million combatants could hardly hope to conquer, much less occupy, the entire Western Realms north of the Fields of the Dead.  Many tense discussions were held in Cormyr, Hill's Edge, Tilverton, Soubar, Shadowdale, and other places in harm's way.

Regular troops and the local militias were sent to Hill's Edge to join the main battle force uniting against the goblinoid horde.

They came from Beregost, Baldur's Gate, Berdusk, Iriaebor, Elturel, Scornubel, Soubar, and the reaches of the High Moor.

No sooner had all the forces arrived than a leader was found:  Artur Blevin, commander of the home forces of Soubar.

The true tragedy of the Battle of Bones is not that the battleground became a gathering place of the undead.  It is that the battle need never have occurred.

All troops on both sides were ordered onto the plain before dawn; all fought whereever they found their foe.  No reserves were held back, and the sphisticated earthen defenses that had been thrown up were left behind in the armies mutual eagerness to fight.  The first rays of dawn did not much help the men in Artur Blevin's forces.  In the night, almost a million feet had stirred the dust.  Swirling with the smoke of a thousad fires, a thick haze hung over the battlefield and no wind dispersed that cloud.  Among Artur Blevin's troops, none escaped unscathed.


--Scrawled in the margins of the pages are a few quick notes.  Some of the legible words read:  'Sureblade', 'Soubar', 'Chionthar Valley', 'bandits', 'rangers should keep watch', and 'revenge'.  You will have to puzzle out these phrases for yourself.

@650240 = ~This notebook contains two entries on seperate pages.  The first reads:

If that makes little sense, the next entry makes even less.  It reads:

"We are battling against the evil LORD DENTON who believes that the world is his.  With our forces outnumbered your missions will involve weakening his powerbase and reducing his numerous allies so that a major assault by our armies can take place to remove him from power.

@650241 = ~Volo's Guide To Fashionable Clothing~
@650242 = ~Preface:
Faerûnian fashion is always changing.  As one travels from frigid Luskan south to wealthy Waterdeep, to the farms of Sembia, to the deserts of Mulhorand, one may never know what is in fashion in any particular place.  NOT ANYMORE!  By popular demand, I, Volothamp Geddarm, have penned this guidebook for the traveling merchant, adventurer, noble on holiday, or migrant farmhand.  Now everyone, from Neverwinter to Suzail, from Calimsham to Damara, will know exactly what to wear and when to wear it and how to wear it. Haven't you ever wondered whether to tie a robe with a belt or a scarf in Waterdeep, or to loop your baldric left to right or right to left if after Midwinter, or if it is appropriate to wear your chainmail under or over your platemail when in Calimsham, or even if you should have your diety's pendant showing or not in Tantras.  NOT ANYMORE!  Read on, gentle reader, and you shall never be mocked for your uneducated fashion again!

This book has a number of pictures as well as description of various articles of clothing.  You skip over most of it, but a few of the entries catch your eye.


Amulets:  Amulets are usually magical devices that are commonly worn around the neck, suspended from a chain.  The type of chain that comes with an amulet generally increases the item's aesthetic value, not its magical properties.  Only one amulet can be dangled from the neck at a time.

Ancient Armor:  This rusted set of armor must be centuries old.  From what you make of it, it must have once been a magnificent set of plate armor.  Fashion Warning:  Unless restored, adventurers wearing ancient armor that is rusted or broken may be ridiculed in many cities or regions of Toril.

Boots:  Boots are normally hand-made by cobblers.  Common boots are made by using a form, but good boots are designed for the foot of an individual.

Boots of the West:  These are the boots that were once owned by the famous woodsman, Randy of the West.  Fashion Warning:  Unless visiting courtesans or brothrels, avoid wearing Boots of the West in public, lest you be noted for your scandalous public carnal activities.

Boots, Worn-Out:  Fashion Advisory:  If your boots every become worn out, it is in your best fashion interest to purchase new ones as soon as you can find a decent cobbler.

Bracers:  Bracers are thick bands of metal or leather that are strapped, belted, or tied to a character's forearm.  Generally, the magic that is instilled in bracers is good only during combat, since most bracers help protect the wearer from injury, or improve chances to strike at an opponent.  Exceptions do exist, though such specialized items are rare at best.

Cloak:  The cloak can be made in every possible shape with just about every type of fabric.  The most common forms are a circular piece of fabric with a hole in the center for the head, and fabric draped from neck, connected by a chain, brooch, cord, or pins.

Gloves:  These leather gloves do not appear to have any special properties, though they are quite fashionable.

Harper Amulets:  All of the Harpers that you have met in this area were wearing one of these amulets. Perhaps it somehow identifies one as being a Harper. Could there be a section of this building that can only be accessed by Harpers?  WARNING:  Unless you have been accepted into the ranks of the Harpers, it is in this authors personal experience (trust me) not to flaunt wearing a Harper amulet.

Harper Pin:  A Harper Pin is a treasured item, signifying that the bearer is an honored and trusted member of the Harpers. It grants the wearer exceptional protection against many different kinds of attacks. They are not attuned to any particular person, but you would be hard pressed to find someone that would lend such an item or even let it out of their sight. It is quite literally a badge of honor.  WARNING:  Again, unless you have been accepted into the ranks of the Harpers, it is in this authors personal experience (trust me) not to flaunt wearing a Harper amulet.

Helms:  This class of open-face helmet, made of reinforced leather or metal, covers most of the head, save the face and neck.  These helmets commonly provide protection for the nose.

Human Flesh:  Made from human skin and treated with the blood of a noble dragon, this armor emits the stench of bitter death. The malevolent armor can only be used by a truly evil person.  WARNING:  It is not acceptable in fashionable society to wear Human Flesh unless you are part of an evil cult or a cannabalistic tribe of barbarians.

Leather Armor:  Basic armor made of thick, wax or water-hardened leather.  It is sturdy protection, not supple like boots or a cloak.  Soft garment leathers like that would offer no more protection than common clothing.  Magical enchantments have improved the protective abilities of this particular suit.

Mage Robes:  Since the age of Netheril, mages have learned to bestow a wide variety of magical properties upon the everyday objects that surround them. A favorite item of such enchantment is the common robe. It is lightweight, affordable, and holds its enchantment well, thereby making it ideal equipment for a mage. Due to their magical heritage, however, only single-, dual-, and multi-class mages may wear these enchanted robes.

Medallion, Mithril:  This is a simple and craftless medallion made of pure mithril, obviously melted down and formed into this crude shape.  It is certainly no piece of art but its composition indicates some worth.

Mirror:  A simple gilt hand mirror.  Fashion advisory:  A must for anyone vain or in need to check their own fashion sense.

Necklaces:  A necklace is a piece of ornamental metal jewelry usually made of silver, gold, platinum, or other precious metals, and adorned with gems.  A necklace is always worn on the neck and can be of any length.

Pantalettes, Bronze:  The pinnacle of style and the epitome of fashion, those of discerning taste would rather wear nothing at all than substitute inferior apparel for the Bronze Pantalettes.

Pantaloons, Golden:  The Golden Pantaloons did surely see the very beginnings of our realm; though I must press that they "saw" this formative time by their simple presence, and not through some vestigial eyes that might have erupted through a rear pocket perhaps concealing teeth and other improbable extremities. I am sure that the various owners of the pantaloons can attest to the general lack of animated digits or ocular sensors, as evidenced by the continued sanctity and privacy maintained by their respective buttocks.  Lyric pantoums of an age long since out of print speak of "trousers that were as metal, though soft about the shanks." While it might be easy to jump to the seemingly inevitable conclusion that the trousers rose while Netheril fell, it is doubtful that the pantaloons were the garments of which they speak. One must clarify these oft-misquoted verses with knowledge of the Pantechnicon, an ancient bazaar once prized for Silver Pantalets. Fine these may have been, but golden they were not. Nickel Panties are also said to be currently available, though the dockside establishments that claim to offer these products are beyond my meager experience, and thus I can make no report.  The purpose of the Pantaloons is as mysterious as ever, and will likely remain so until the Pantocrator himself returns, though some properties can be divined though intimate observation. The "uplifting" properties of the gusset very nearly defy gravity, shaping quite nicely both the front and rear. This improved contour would likely increase self-esteem for a wearer of either sex. I would hazard a guess, however, that this continuing self delusion might actually hamper cognitive functions, and care should be taken in the wearing of any pantaloons of golden nature.

Pantaloons, Power Pantaloon Battle Armor:  Found within a long forgotten pocket of our collected pantology, herein tales the lie of the Metal "Unit".  Gargantua was self-proclaimed lord of his immeasurable lower regions until his son, Pantagruel, questioned the accuracy of the ruler. With his shortcomings exposed, great Gargantua lay prostrate upon the ground while Pantagruel sought to cover his cuirass in case his now governing body lost its sway. He was warned that the people would cut him no slacks, but he never listened, and had burned his britches behind him. Undaunted, he fulfilled his animus with the robes of his father, as uncomfortable as that might sound, and shaped the Metal "Unit" with his own hands.  The rule of Pantagruel was a discommoding morass, his armor eventually suffering a breach in the breech that proved his undoing. As his basket left the pantry, so to speak, his regime fell to insurrection, and so complete was the sacking that not even his Metal "Unit" could be found. The component pieces, a pantaloon triumvirate, were lost in the annals of time.  You now bear the awesome responsibility of the Metal "Unit". Gussets of wind, seams like reality, pockets of resistance, the seat of power, and legs as flared as your temper. Polish it well; the onus is now on you.

Pantaloons, Silver:  A high quality pair of silver pantaloons.

Pelts:  The pure white pelt of the winter wolf is soft and luxurious. It is often sewn into garments as diverse as the rugged vests of the northern Uthgardt Barbarians and the delicate and fashionable winter stoles worn by noblewomen throughout the Sword Coast region.

Pipes, Meerschaum:  This is a dark and delicately-crafted meerschaum pipe used for smoking particular roots and odorous plants.  It appears to have been carved from felsul root, itself, and smells faintly of brimstone and cinnamon.

Rings:  A ring is a small band of precious metal that is used as jewelry.  Some rare rings have had enchantments placed upon them that confer various magical abilities.  These rings are highly sought after, especially by those of the adventuring profession.

Scalp, Bandit:  This is the scalp of a bandit.  Perhaps worth money to the right person.  Fashion Warning:  It is not advisable to wear bandit scalps as toupees.

Shields:  A shield is usually round and is carried on the forearm, gripped with the shield hand.  Its light weight as compared to a medium shield permits the user to carry other items in that hand, although he cannot wield or carry another weapon.  Fashion Advisory:  Always wear something else with your shield.  DO NOT only carry a shield as your only article of fashion.~
@650243 = ~Volo's Guide To Faerûnian Wine~
@650244 = ~Preface:
In all my travels, I've partaken more than my share of fermented grapes, yet I have never met the equal of the wine merchant I once came across in a dark tavern in the small town of Soubar, northwest of Amn and west of Baldur's Gate, nestled in the lush farmlands of the Chionthar River Valley.  This merchant, whom I never caught by name, knew more about the vineyards, distilleries, and wines of every wine-producing region of Faerûn than anyone else I have met.  It is in his honor that I write this Guidebook.


The book is divided into three chapters, and it would take far too long to read the entire thing, so you peruse the beginning of each chapter.

Chapter One:  Types of Wines

Dessert wines created with the Lehua Blossom and honey gathered from the blooms of the native Lantan 'Ohia Tree are made without grapes or fruit.  These wines are not meads, but are drier than the other honey wines and have a smooth taste of tropical sweetness.  Rice wines are fermented alcoholic drinks produced with cereals with wheat as saccharifying and fermenting agents.  They may often have other traditional names in various regions, "Lao Jiu" is aged rice wine, "Shui Jji" is dilluted rice wine.  The Shou take great pride in their rice wines all the times.


Chapter Two:  Wine Regions and Distinctions

Wineries in the North, in the regions of Waterdeep and Neverwinter, produce wines of intensity and depth not found in the inland regions because of the cool coastal climates.  It is from these regions along the north Sword Coast that most wineries select fruit for their wines, capturing the robust aromas and supple flavors.  Turmish Wine is an excellent extra-dry white dinner wine.  Made with Turmish grapes- no honey or fruit- this crisp and classy white has an aromatic and refreshing bouquet of peach, apricot, and lychee.  Turmish Wine is excellent with chees, fruit, fish, chicken, and Kara-Turian food.  Lantanese Wine is often an exotic tropical fruit blend made by blending local Lantan yellow quava fruit concentrate with chablis grape juice which offers a fruity sweetness.  It is delicious with curries, Shou food, lamb, pork, and desserts.  The Corwellian wineries of Eveningstar are made up of nine associated estates whose vineyards are located in Faerûn's most renowned wine growing areas.  The spacious cellar in one of Eveningstar's wineries, Banear, can hold up to one million barrels of wine.  Here, the finest grapes produced by the associated estates of Eveningstar are brought to Banear for processing, and are turned into the Banear range of traditional Corwellian wines, after a carefully controlled fermentation made with selected yeasts and maintained at low temperatures.  Alurlyath Wine is made with 100% Alurlyath grapes.  Refined for 4 to 6 months in cask, this is a full bodied cabernet with a rich and smooth character from the gravelly soil of the region.  Alurlyath Wine displays a deep, ruby color and ripe Alurlyath fruit in a spicy style.  It is the perfect complement for roasted meats and robusts cheeses when served at room temperature.

Chapter Three:  The Hlondeth Aphrunn Wines

In Aphrunn Ridge wines, ripe fruit carries throughout the flavors.  The finish is silky and supple with a hint of smoky oak rounding out the wine.  It can be enjoyed with lamb, beef, or hearty Impiltur pasta dishes.  At the Hlondeth Aphrunn Ridge Winery, more than 4,600 wine filled oak barrels line the aisles of the caves located 100 feet below the surface.  As a natural insulator made of volcanic rock, the caves provide a constant temperature of 65° and 85% humidity for the premium wines.  Aphrunn Ridge uses almost exclusively Cormyrian oak barrels from Cormyrian coopers in their wine production.  They purchase more than 1,000 barrels annually at the current production level.  Hlondeth Aphrunn Ridge Winery selects traditional barrel styles, woods, and toasting levels to compliment the wine, for example, heavy toasted Dhedluk barrels for the chardonnay, or heavy toasted Wheloon barrels for a particular cabernet.  They must order the barrels almost a year in advance and any barrelscoopered in Cormyr are delivered by boat to Hlondeth.  New Cormyr oak barrels cost approximately 600 to 700 gold pieces each while Sembian oak barrels are 300 gold pieces each.  The variation in cost is due to type of wood species, method of splitting the wood, and shipping.


The book's chapters do elaborate on the specific topics, however, you find this book about wine too dry for your taste.~
@650245 = ~Volo's Guide To Inns and Taverns of Amn~
@650246 = ~Preface:
In all my travels, I've slept in, drank at, and socialized in more than my share of inns, taverns, and festhalls.  By far, the most varied selection of inns can be found in the nation-state of Amn, particularly in the capital city of Athkatla.  I shall attempt to guide you, gentle reader, through these inns and taverns, hopefully reviewing each with fairness and an unbiased view of the services, and service, offered.

The book has no actual format, but is rather a list of inns along with a few brief notes about each.  You glance at the list and the associated review.

The Copper Coronet:
One of the more popular local bars/taverns/festhalls of Athkatla, this can be a rough place.  Everything one could ever want from a seedy tavern, including hourly gambling on gladiators, can be bought here.  Bernard, the fat, slobby innkeep that one would expect to find running such an establishment, is more often than not drunk on his own brew.  Sleep here, and you may get a rash.  Get drunk here, and you may get a gash.  In case of rashes or gashes, Bernard has some potions for sale, and may even sell you a blade to fend off the rowdies or a longer polearm for the courtesans.

Delosar's Inn:
Calbor is by far one of the rudest innkeeps I've ever had the displeasure of meeting.  No entertainment, no service, clean-but not immaculate- rooms, and a poor selection of food and drink make this an inn to get out of.

Mithrest Inn:
A pleasant inn, run by the pleasant Pugney, in Athkatla's wealthier section.  It's a friendly place, a bit prudish, and the nobles all look down their noses at a well-traveled critic or adventurer alike.  There are some nice rooms here, and the selection of drinks can be a bit pricey, but are worth the extra gold for a finely brewed decanter of brandy.

The Five Flagons:
A bard's best dream, and the reason a critic's enjoys traveling.  Say hello to Samuel if you stop by here, and tell him I sent you.  Take a look at one of the largest selections of beer, ale, wine, scotch, or any other fermented beverage that Faerûn has to offer.  If you are able, be sure to head downstairs to see one of the fine dramatic productions that Raelis and the Sigil Troupe put on.  It's only a donation of five gold pieces, but hope you don't see one of the tragedies or comedies on an evening that the understudy "acts."

Gorch's Tavern:
This is definately not a big social center.  When I arrived- and when I left- there was no one else there.  In fact, I was able to get a drink, but didn't dare sit on one of the stools for fear it would stick to my behind.  For all the bartending Gorch did, he could have at least wiped the bar clean.  This building is large, however, Gorch wouldn't even let me enjoy my brandy by the fireplace in the sitting room.  I didn't spend a whole lot of time- or coin- here, and I wouldn't suggest you, gentle reader, do either.

Den of Seven Vales:
If you stop by this inn, ask Patricia about the name.  Interesting story, if quite condensed, but I'll let her tell it as many times as she likes.  Patricia is a personable innkeep, and keeps the place in good condition.  This is more of a travelers inn, not a locals bar, with affordable rates and drinks, and I would suggest it to any merchant or adventurer out of all the other inns found within Athkatla.

The Crooked Crane:
Cheap rooms, cheap drinks, but Groncaner the innkeep is helpful enough.  This is the first inn a visitor to Athkatla spots upon arriving to the Amnish city coming through the Gates, and if you are in need enough or have a steed, their stables are clean and take decent care of your steed.  Groncaner will even let you use the loft as a quick shelter for the night if you're short gold.

The Sea's Bounty:
This inn and tavern has a sense of the familiar with every other inn or tavern along the Sword Coast.  Down by the city Docks, it smells of salt and fish and sweaty sailors, if you are into that sort of thing.  The Thumb is the proprietor, and is a decent fellow even if his words are a bit slurred.  Don't shake his hand though.  The Bounty has a decent range of drinks, from watered ale to Evermead, but the rooms need a woman's touch indeed.  I paid sixteen gold for the best room, and it didn't even have a Tymoran Prayer book or complimentary lard bar.

While in Amn, there are a few other inns that one could stop by.  Located a few hours west is a homely place, the Umar Hills Inn, run by Vinnie- pardon, Vincenzo- a pleasant man to the locals and visitors, but don't let his insults towards Willet fool you.  I got the impression that he does indeed care about the boy.  This inn has good rooms, private dining if desired or requested, and even a couple of merchants can be found nearby.  A day's journay south of the hills is a small trading village- Trademeet- which has a single inn.  Vyatri's is run by, of all people, Vyatri, a nice fellow, cornfed and protly on his own prepared roasts and stews.  The inn boasts average rooms, a decent selection of drinks, but by far some of the spicest rabbit or boar stew south of Baldur's Gate.  Be sure to enjoy the musical stylings of Alenina, one of the finest bards outside of Silverymoon in Amn.

Also, while I was touring Amn, I did travel to the island "resort" of Brynnlaw.  At least I thought it was a resort prior to my arrival.  Brynnlaw's Inn- I named it- is smack dab in the center of the isolated town.  If you have the coin, you'll be welcome here.  If not, don't even risk getting your throat cut.  Don't go here for the rooms, nor waste your gold on what is passed off as beer, as I think the innkeep "brews" his drinks straight from the Sea of Swords itself.  However, while in Brynnlaw, I did stop by Lady Galvena's.  Quite an establishment she has there.  It was the only interesting point of my visit to the island.  Drinks are on the house, as long as you're tipping the Ladies, and rent for the rooms is by the hour.  Nothing here for the prudish, but one doesn't expect to find anyone looking for clean and sanitary inns on the island of Brynnlaw anyhow.  Just be sure, if you visit Lady Galvena's, to bring your own sheep's bladder or dive off the docks for some sea sponges.~
